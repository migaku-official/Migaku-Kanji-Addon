##  Primitives with missing Heisig stories and comments
### Most of the comment are moved from the entries of the first kanjis that refer to them
#### 丨 stick (number one, line, rod radical (no. 2))
| Field | Old value | New value |
|---|---|---|
| primitive_alternatives |  | ノ |
| heisig_story         | None | This primitive element is a picture of just what it looks like: a cane or <b>walking stick</b>. It carries with it the connotations of lameness and whatever else one associates with the use of a cane. Rarely—but very rarely—it will be laid on its side. Whenever this occurs, it will always be driven through the middle of some other primitive element. In this way, you need not worry about confusing it with the primitive meanings of <i>one</i>. [1] |
#### 卜 magic wand, divining rod / magic wand, divining rod (divining, fortune-telling, divination or katakana to radical (no. 25))
| Field | Old value | New value |
|---|---|---|
| primitive_keywords   | magic wand | magic wand, divining rod |
| heisig_story         | None | This is a picture of a <b>divining rod</b>, composed of a <i>drop</i> and a <i>walking stick</i>, but easy enough to remember as a pictograph. Alternately, you can think of it as a <b>magic wand</b>. In either case, it should suggest images of magic or fortune-telling. Nowadays it is written in the stroke order given here when it appears as a primitive, but until recently the order was often reversed (in order to instill correct habits for more stylized calligraphy). [2] |
| heisig_comment       | None | Although it falls outside of the list of general-use kanji, this element is actually a kanji in its own right, having virtually the same meaning as the kanji in the next frame. |
#### ハ animal legs ()
| Field | Old value | New value |
|---|---|---|
| heisig_story         | None | Like the four that follow it, this primitive is not a kanji in its own right, though it is said to be derived from 八, the character we learned earlier for eight. It always comes at the bottom of the primitive to which it is related. It can mean the <b>legs</b> of any kind of animal: from a grizzly bear’s paws to an octopus’s tentacles to the spindle shanks of a spider. (The one animal not allowed is our friend homo sapiens, whose legs figure in the next frame.) Even where the term legs will apply metaphorically to the legs of pieces of furniture, it is best to keep the association with <b>animal legs</b>. (You may review frame 6 here.) [2] |
#### 儿 human legs (legs radical (no. 10))
| Field | Old value | New value |
|---|---|---|
| heisig_story         | None | Notice how these <b>human legs</b> are somewhat shapelier and more highly evolved than those of the so-called “lower animals.” The one on the left, drawn first, is straight; while the one on the right bends gracefully and ends with a hook. Though they are not likely to suggest the legs of any human you know, they do have something of the look of someone out for a stroll, especially if you compare them to <i>animal legs</i>. If you had any trouble with the kanji for the number four, now would be the time to return to it (frame 4). [2] |
#### 几 wind (table, table enclosure, table or windy radical (no. 16))
| Field | Old value | New value |
|---|---|---|
| primitive_keywords   |  | wind |
| heisig_story         | None | This primitive gets its name from the full kanji for the <b>wind</b> (frame 524). It is called an “enclosure” because other elements are often drawn in the middle of it, though it can also be compressed together so that there is no room for anything in it. The main thing to remember when writing this element is that the second stroke bends outwards, like a gust of <b>wind</b> blown from above. In addition to the basic meaning of <b>wind</b>, we shall also have occasion to use the image of a weather vane. The derivation is obvious. [2] |
#### 勹 bound up (wrapping enclosure, wrapping radical (no. 20))
| Field | Old value | New value |
|---|---|---|
| primitive_alternatives |  | ⺈ |
| heisig_story         | None | Like wind, the element meaning <b>bound up</b> is also an enclosure that can wrap itself around other elements or be compressed when there is nothing to enclose. When this latter happens— usually because there is not enough room—and it is set on top, the little hook at the end is dropped off, like this: ⺈. The sense of <b>bound up</b> is that of being “tied and gagged” or wrapped up tightly. If you have trouble remembering when it serves as an enclosure (with the hook) and when not (without the hook), you might think of the former as a chain and the latter as a rope. [2] |
#### 丷 animal horns ()
| Field | Old value | New value |
|---|---|---|
| heisig_story         | None | This primitive element always appears at the top of the element to which it is related, and is always attached, or almost attached, to the first horizontal line to come under it. The horns can never simply be left hanging in the air. When there is no line available, an extra horizontal stroke (like a one) is added. The final kanji of this lesson gives an example. The meaning of this element is wide enough to embrace the horns of bulls, rams, billy goats, and moose, but not the family of musical instruments. As with other elements with such “open” meanings, it is best to settle on one that you find most vivid and stick with that image consistently. [2] |
#### 畐 wealth (to fill, roll of cloth)
| Field | Old value | New value |
|---|---|---|
| primitives           |  | 一口田 |
| heisig_story         | None | To prepare for following frame, we introduce here a somewhat rare primitive meaning <b>wealth</b>. It takes its meaning from the common image of the over<b>wealth</b>y as overfed. More specifically, the kanji shows us <i>one</i> single <i>mouth</i> devouring all the harvest of the <i>fields</i>, presumably while those who labor in them go hungry. Think of the phrase exactly as it is written when you draw the character, and the disposition of the elements is easy. [9] |
#### 宀 house (shaped crown, katakana u radical (no. 40))
| Field | Old value | New value |
|---|---|---|
| heisig_story         | None | This extremely useful primitive element depicts the roof of a <b>house</b>. You can see the chimney at the top and the eaves on either side without much trouble. It is a “crown” element, which means that it is invariably set atop other things. Examples follow immediately. [3] |
#### 莫 graveyard / graveyard (must not, do not, be not)
| Field | Old value | New value |
|---|---|---|
| primitives           |  | 艹日大 |
| heisig_story         | None | The element shown here should be taken to represent a modern <b>graveyard</b>. Gone are the cobwebs and gnarled trees, the tilted headstones and dark, moonless nights that used to scare the wits out of our childhood imaginations. Instead, we see brightly colored <i>flowers</i> placed before the tombstones, the <i>sun</i> shining gloriously overhead, and a cuddly <i>St. Bernard</i> sitting at the gate keeping watch. [10] |
#### 攵 taskmaster (strike, hit, folding chair radical variant (no. 66))
| Field | Old value | New value |
|---|---|---|
| heisig_story         | None | First find the long rod (the first stroke), held in the hand of someone seated (the next 3 strokes, not unlike the pictograph for <i>woman</i>, but quite different from that for <i>walking legs</i> introduced in Lesson 13). The only thing left to do is conjure up the memory of some <b>taskmaster</b> (or taskmistress) from your past whom you will “never forget.” [4] |
#### 夂 walking legs (late, delayed, winter radical (no. 34))
| Field | Old value | New value |
|---|---|---|
| heisig_story         | None | We call this element <b>walking legs</b> because it indicates “legs in motion,” whether you want to think of them as jogging or walking in long strides, as the shape seems to suggest. Be careful how you write it, with the first two strokes like a stylized “7.” [3] |
#### 冖 (wa-shaped crown radical (no. 14))
| Field | Old value | New value |
|---|---|---|
| heisig_story         | None | This pictograph of a simple <b>crown</b> is distinguished from the roof only by the absence of the chimney (the first <i>drop</i> at the top). It can be used for all the principal connotations of the word <b>crown</b>. We will meet the full character from which this element is derived later on, in FRAME 326. [2] |
#### 囗 pent in (box, box or enclosure radical (no. 31))
| Field | Old value | New value |
|---|---|---|
| heisig_story         | None | This primitive depicts a corral or pen surrounding something, which is thus <b>pent in</b>. [3] |
#### 亠 is NOT a roof!
#### 亠 top hat (kettle lid radical (no. 8))
| Field | Old value | New value |
|---|---|---|
| primitive_keywords   | roof, hat | top hat |
| heisig_story         | None | The broad rim and tall top of the <b>top hat</b> is pictured graphically here in these two simple strokes. At this point, by the way, you can revert back to FRAME 6. If you have had any trouble with that character, you now have the requisite elements to make a story: <b>Six</b> suggests the number of an ant’s <i>legs</i>; just set a tall silk <i>top hat</i> on the crawling creature and you have your character. [2] |

----
##  癶 teepee primitive
#### 癶 teepee (dotted tent radical (no. 105))
| Field | Old value | New value |
|---|---|---|
| heisig_story         | None | The dots at the top of this tent are the wooden poles protruding outside the canvas walls of a <b>teepee</b>. [5] |
#### 登  (ascend, climb up)
| Field | Old value | New value |
|---|---|---|
| heisig_story         | teepee The dots at the top of this tent are the wooden poles protruding outside the canvas walls of a teepee. [5] | <i>Teepee</i> ... <i>table</i>. Do not confuse with rise up (FRAME 43). [12] |

----
##  辶 road primitive
#### 辶 road (walk, walking, road radical variant (no. 162))
| Field | Old value | New value |
|---|---|---|
| primitive_keywords   | way | road |
| heisig_story         | None | The <b>road</b> envisioned here is a <b>road</b> for traffic, or a path or walkway. The natural sweep of these three simple strokes should be easy to remember, as it appears so often. [3] |
#### 道  (road-way, street, district, journey, course, moral, teachings)
| Field | Old value | New value |
|---|---|---|
| heisig_story         | road The road envisioned here is a road for traffic, or a path or walkway. The natural sweep of these three simple strokes should be easy to remember, as it appears so often. [3] | The key word carries both the sense of a <b>road</b> for transit and a <b>way</b> or method of doing something, but the former is better for forming an image. The primitives read: the <i>neck</i> of a <i>road</i>. Think of a crowded <b>road-way</b> where traffic has come to a standstill—what we commonly refer to as a “bottle<i>neck</i>.” [12] |

----
##  冂 hood primitive
#### 冂 hood, glass canopy, belt (upside-down box radical (no. 13))
| Field | Old value | New value |
|---|---|---|
| primitive_keywords   | hood, belt | hood, glass canopy, belt |
| heisig_story         | None | In addition to the basic meaning of <b>hood</b>, this shape can be used for a glass canopy, such as that used to serve “pheasant under glass.” Note its difference from the element for wind: the second stroke is hooked inwards here. To help remember this detail, think of the wind as blowing “out” and a <b>glass canopy</b> as keeping something “in.” Among the related images suggested by this primitive are: a monk’s cowl, a riding <b>hood</b>, a helmet, and an automobile <b>hood</b>. [2] |
| heisig_comment       | None | Editor's note: This primitive is used for both <b>hood</b> and <b>belt</b>. The only difference is that the former is used for encompassing other primitives (like in '<i>同 same</i>') whereas the latter is used when it goes through other primitives (such as in '<i>刺 thorn</i>') |
#### 刺  (thorn, pierce, stab, prick, sting, calling card)
| Field | Old value | New value |
|---|---|---|
| heisig_story         | belt(pas, pasek) This primitive, clearly derived from that for towel, is always hung on another vertical stroke, and takes the meaning of a belt. [2] | <b>Thorns</b> grow on a bush here that has wrapped itself around a <i>tree</i> like a <i>belt</i>, cutting into the poor <i>tree</i> like little <i>sabers</i>. [8] |

----
##  亢 whirlwind primitive
#### 亢 whirlwind (high spirits)
| Field | Old value | New value |
|---|---|---|
| primitives           |  | 亠几 |
| heisig_story         | None | A formal high silk <i>top hat</i> resting atop a weather vane represents a <b>whirlwind</b>. To keep it distinct from the primitive for <i>wind</i>, try to picture the vortex, or tornado-like spinning movement, of a <b>whirlwind</b>. The next frame should help. [4] |
#### 坑  (pit, hole)
| Field | Old value | New value |
|---|---|---|
| heisig_story         | top hat @ The broad rim and tall top of the top hat is pictured graphically here in these two simple strokes. At this point, by the way, you can revert back to FRAME 6 六. If you have had any trouble with that character, you now have the requisite elements to make a story: Six suggests the number of spider’s legs; just set a tall silk top hat on the crawling creature and you have your character. [2] | A <i>whirlwind</i> begins to dig its way into the <i>soil</i> like a drill until it makes a deep <b>pit</b>. [7] |

----
##  云 rising cloud primitive
#### 云 rising cloud / rising cloud (say)
| Field | Old value | New value |
|---|---|---|
| heisig_story         | None | This primitive is meant to depict in graphic fashion a <b>cloud</b> of something <b>rising</b> upwards, like vapor or smoke or dust. [4] |
#### 転  (revolve, turn around, change)
| Field | Old value | New value |
|---|---|---|
| heisig_story         | rising cloud(wznoszaca sie chmura) This primitive is meant to depict in graphic fashion a cloud of something or other rising upwards, like vapor or smoke or dust. [4] | As the wheels of the <i>car</i> <b>revolve</b>, they kick up small <i>rising clouds</i> of dust and debris behind them. [11] |

----
##  'stretch' radical
#### 廴 stretch (long stride or stretching radical (no. 54))
| Field | Old value | New value |
|---|---|---|
| primitive_keywords   |  | stretch |
| heisig_story         | None | The primitive meaning to <b>stretch</b> might at first seem similar to that for road. Take a moment to study it more carefully and you will see the difference. Like road, this character holds other primitives above its sweeping final stroke. [3] |
#### 建  (build)
| Field | Old value | New value |
|---|---|---|
| heisig_story         | stretch(rozciagac) The primitive meaning to stretch might at first seem similar to that for road. Take a moment to study it more carefully and you will see the difference. Like road, this character holds other primitives above its sweeping final stroke. [3] | To construct a <b>build</b>ing, you first draw a set of plans (the writing <i>brush</i>) and then s-t-r-e-t-c-h your drawing out to scale in reality. [9]  |

----
##  丶 'drop of' primitive
#### switch primitive from 丿 to 丶 when it is clearly a 'drop'. Otherwise list both
#### 丶 drop (dot, tick or dot radical (no. 3))
| Field | Old value | New value |
|---|---|---|
| heisig_story         | None | The meaning of this primitive is obvious from the first moment you look at it, though just what it will be a <b>drop</b> of will differ from case to case. The important thing is not to think of it as something insignificant like a <b>“drop</b> in the bucket” but as something so important that it can change the whole picture— like a <b>drop</b> of arsenic in your mother-in-law’s coffee. [1] |
| heisig_comment       | None | In general, it is written from right to left, but there are times when it can be slanted left to right. At other times it can be stretched out a bit: ノ. (In cases where you have trouble remembering this, it may help to think of it as an eyedropper dripping drops of something or other.) Examples will follow in this lesson. |
#### 少  (few, little)
| Field | Old value | New value |
|---|---|---|
| primitives           | 小丿 | 小丶丿 |
| heisig_story         | First we need to look at the fourth stroke, the <i>drop</i> at the bottom that has been extended into a longer diagonal stroke leaning left. This happens because a single, isolated drop will NEVER appear beneath its relative primitive in its normal size, for fear it would drop off and get lost. As for the meaning, let the tiny <i>drop</i> indicate a further belittling of what is already <i>little</i> - thus making it a <b>few</b> of something <i>little</i>. | First we need to look at the fourth stroke, the <i>drop</i> at the bottom that has been extended into a longer diagonal stroke leaning left.

#### 失 to drop / to drop (lose, error, fault, disadvantage, loss)

| heisig_comment       | As a primitive, this character can also mean to drop. | As a primitive, this character can also mean <b>to drop</b>. |

#### 系 yam / yam (lineage, system)
| Field | Old value | New value |
|---|---|---|
| heisig_story         | The single stroke added to the beginning of the primitive for <i>thread</i> gives the image of threads woven into a single cord. Hence the meaning, <b>lineage</b>. | The single stroke added to the beginning of the primitive for <i>thread</i> gives the image of <i>thread</i>s woven into a single cord. Hence the meaning, <b>lineage</b>. |
| heisig_comment       | As a primitive, we shall give this kanji the meaning of <i>yarn</i>, as the uniting of many threads into a single strand is most obvious with <i>yarn</i>. | As a primitive, we shall give this kanji the meaning of <i>yarn</i>, as the uniting of many <i>thread</i>s into a single strand is most obvious with <i>yarn</i>. |
#### 呂  (spine, backbone)
| Field | Old value | New value |

#### 属 genius / genius (belong, genus, subordinate official, affiliated)
| Field | Old value | New value |

#### 乏  (destitution, scarce, limited)

#### 朱  (vermilion, cinnabar, scarlet, red, bloody)
| Field | Old value | New value |
|---|---|---|
| primitives           | 丿未 | 丿丶未 |
| heisig_story         | That red-orange color we call <b>vermilion</b> is found in nature during the fall when the leaves lose their sugar and begin to change color. This kanji depicts the very last leaf on a tree in the fall (the <i>drop</i> hung in the first stroke), the leaf that has <i>not yet</i> fallen as it one day must. Look at its color - vermilion. (Well, not really. The truth is, <b>vermilion</b> is made from a mercuric sulfide, but I'm sure you will agree that autumn leaves area lot easier to work with.) | That red-orange color we call <b>vermilion</b> is found in nature during the fall when the leaves lose their sugar and begin to change color.

#### 升  (measuring box, 1.8 liter)
| Field | Old value | New value |
|---|---|---|
| primitives           | 丿廾 | 亻千十 |
| heisig_story         | This is the character for the little wooden box that the Japanese use for measuring things, as well as for drinking saké out of. Simply imagine the outside as spiked with a <i>thousand</i> sharp <i>needles</i>, and the quaint little <b>measuring box</b> becomes a drinker's nightmare! Be very careful when you write this character not to confuse it with the writing of <i>thousand</i>. The reason for the difference gives us a chance to clarify another general principle of writing that supersedes the one we mentioned in frame 4: when a single stroke runs vertically through the middle of a character, it is written last. | This is the character for the little wooden box that the Japanese use for measuring things, as well as for drinking saké out of.

| heisig_comment       | None | Editor's note: The stroke order of <i>thousand</i> 千 doesn't actually match this character, but person 亻 should be used instead. ノ + 廾 (two hands) do not match either.  |

----
##  Add primitive alternative for 'ice'
#### 冫 (two-stroke water radical or ice radical (no. 15))
| Field | Old value | New value |
|---|---|---|
| primitive_alternatives |  | ⺀ |
| heisig_story         | None | The condensation of the three drops we have been using to mean <i>water</i> into two drops signals the solidifying of <i>water</i> into <b>ice</b>. Note that when this primitive appears to the left, it is written like the last two strokes of the element for <i>water</i>, 冫, whereas under another primitive, it is written like the first two strokes of the water primitive: ⺀. [2] |
#### 冬  (winter)
| Field | Old value | New value |
|---|---|---|
| heisig_story         | ice(lod) A The condensation of the three drops we have been using to mean water into two drops signals the solidifying of water into ice. Note that when this primitive appears to the left, it is written like the last two strokes of the element for water, A, whereas under another primitive, it is written like the first two strokes of the water primitive: V. [2] | <i>Walking legs</i> slipping on the <i>ice</i> are a sure sign of <b>winter</b>. [5] |

----
##  啇 antique primitive
#### 啇 antique (the stalk, the stem, the foot, the base)
| Field | Old value | New value |
|---|---|---|
| primitives           |  | 立冂古 |
| heisig_story         | None | The primitive meaning <b>antique</b>, not itself a kanji, depicts a <i>vase</i> kept under a <i>glass hood</i> because it is very, very <i>old</i>. [11] |
#### 嫡  (legitimate wife, direct descent (non-bastard))
| Field | Old value | New value |
|---|---|---|
| heisig_story         | antique(antyk, zabytek) The primitive meaning antique, not itself a kanji, depicts a vase kept under a glass hood because it is very, very old. [11] | The phrase <b>legitimate wife</b> would have no meaning if there were not such a thing as an “il<b>legitimate wife</b>,” taken because one’s legal <i>woman</i> has turned into an <i>antique</i>. The very offense of the idea should help you remember the kanji. [14] |

##  𠂉 reclining primitive
### This is NOT a 'man' primitive !!
#### 𠂉 lying down, reclining ()
| Field | Old value | New value |
|---|---|---|
| primitive_keywords   | man, lying down, reclining | lying down, reclining |
| heisig_story         | None | The picture is obvious: the first stroke represents the head, and the second the body of someone <b>reclining</b>. You may also use the synonyms <i>lying</i> or <i>lying down</i>. [2] |
#### 毎  (every)
| Field | Old value | New value |
|---|---|---|
| heisig_story         | reclining(klasc, opierac sie) The picture is obvious: the first stroke represents the head, and the second the body of someone reclining. You may also use the synonyms lying or lying down. [2] | “Behind <b>every</b> successful person <i>lies</i> a woman...,” who usually turns out to be one’s <i>mama</i>! [6] |

##  ⺶ wool primitive

| heisig_story | This rather uncommon primitive is made by pulling the tail of the <i>sheep</i> to one side to create a semi-enclosure. The meaning of <b>wool</b> is derived from the fact that the shearer is holding the <i>sheep</i> by the tail in order to trim its <b>wool</b>. [7] |

##  广 cave primitive
#### 广 cave (dotted cliff radical (no. 53))
| Field | Old value | New value |
|---|---|---|
| primitives           |  | 厂 |
| heisig_story         | None | This primitive combines the <i>cliff</i> (the last 2 strokes) with the first dot we use on the roof of the <i>house</i>. Together they make a “cliff house” or cave. It “encloses” its relative primitives beneath it and to the right. [3] |
#### 店  (store, shop)

Whatever the parable's significance for modern civilization and its arsenals, it should help with this kanji. Oh yes, we should not forget that cliff-like element. Think of it as an abbreviation of the primitive for <i>zoo</i> (the first and fourth strokes, actually), in order to fit the <b>tiger</b> somewhere into the picture.

Conveniently, it is always drawn at the very bottom of any kanji in which itfigures. Thefirst stroke, the horizontal one, is detached from anything above it, but is necessary to distinguish <b>tool</b> from animal legs. The sense of the element is a carpenter’s <b>tool</b>, which comes from its pictographic representation of a small table with legs (make them animal legs if you need a more graphic image), so that any element lying on top of it will come to be viewed as a <b>tool</b> in the hands of a carpenter.
