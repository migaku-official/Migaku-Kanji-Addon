#### Add Heisig stories
#### 書 write (write)
| Field | Old value | New value |
|---|---|---|
| heisig_story         | brush(pedzel) This primitive element, not itself a kanji, is a pictograph of a writing brush. Let the first 3 strokes represent the hairs at the tip of the brush, and the following two strokes the thumb and forefinger that guide it when you write. Note how the long vertical stroke, cutting through everything, is drawn last. This is standard procedure when you have such a stroke running the length of a character. However, as we saw in the case of cow, when this primitive appears on top of another primitive, its "tail" is cut off, giving us D. [6] | The sage talks rapidly with his <i>tongue wagging in his mouth</i>, while the <i>brush</i> of the scribe runs apace to <b>write</b> down the master’s words. [10] |
#### 冗 superfluous (superfluous, uselessness)
| Field | Old value | New value |
|---|---|---|
| heisig_story         | crown This pictograph of a simple crown is distinguished from the roof only by the absence of the chimney (the first drop at the top). It can be used for all the principal connotations of the word crown. We will meet the full character from which this element is derived later on, in FRAME 304 冠. [2] | Picture a <i>weather</i> vane beneath a regal <i>crown</i>, spinning round and round. It is not only <b>superfluous</b> but makes a perfect ass out of the one who wears it. [4] |
#### 布 linen (linen, cloth, spread, distribute)
| Field | Old value | New value |
|---|---|---|
| heisig_story         | towel(recznik) The basic meaning of this primitive is a bolt of cloth, from which we derive the meaning of a towel. [3] | The maid, <i>towels</i> <i>by her side</i>, distributes the <b>linen</b>. [5] |
#### 鏡 mirror (mirror, speculum, barrel-head, round rice-cake offering)
| Field | Old value | New value |
|---|---|---|
| heisig_story         | mirror(lustro) This primitive gets its meaning from the following FRAME. It shows a pair of human legs and a tongue-wagging mouth looking at a mirror standing on the wall, asking perhaps who might be the fairest of them all. [11] | After lakes but before glass, polished <i>metal</i> was used for mirrors. These <i>metal</i> <b>mirrors</b> are recalled in this character for a <b>mirror</b>. [19] |
#### 各 each (each, every, either)
| Field | Old value | New value |
|---|---|---|
| heisig_story         | walking legs We call this element walking legs because it indicates "legs in motion," whether you want to think of them as jogging or walking in long strides, as the shape seems to suggest. Be careful how you write it, with the first two strokes like a stylized "7." [3] | “Suum cuique” goes the popular Latin proverb. A certain disease of the English language makes it almost impossible to translate the phrase without gender bias. In any event, here we see someone walking with his/her <i>mouth</i> between his/her <i>walking legs</i>, giving us an image of “To <b>each</b> his/her own.” [6] |

| heisig_comment       | The primitive meaning remains the same as that of the kanji, but special attention has to be given to the varieties of shape this element can undergo. It is the most difficult one you will meet in this book. When it appears BENEATH its relative primitive, the top three strokes are omitted ([row-bottom]), though the third horizontal stroke may be doubled up with the bottom horizontal stroke of the element above it (as in 繊 or 湿). ATOP its relative primitive, it can keep its kanji shape. When it does not, the top three strokes are removed and all of them are replaced BELOW the primitive's bottom line ([in_a_row_upside_down] as in 業). We shall acknowledge this latter transformation by changing its meaning to <i>upside down in a row</i>. Editor's note: You can use the row 並 primitive as described by Heisig, or you can switch to use it's basic components 业 (spikes) and 䒑 (grass, weeds) which were not included in RTK. You can decide case by case for each kanji these elements are introduced in.    | The primitive meaning remains the same as that of the kanji, but special attention has to be given to the varieties of shape this element can undergo.
