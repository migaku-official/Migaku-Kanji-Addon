# remove non-Heisig primitive 戉
越	surpass, cross over, move to, exceed, Vietnam		走戊	surpass	surpass		Here we see two <i>parades</i> in competition, each trying to <b>surpass</b> the other by <i>running</i> at high speed from one town to the next. Note the little "hook" at the end of the first stroke of the element for <i>parade</i>. This is the ONLY time it appears like this in the kanji treated in this book.		走土戈

###### 己 self - add 'snake' alternative primitive. Removed reference to 已
己	self			self	self	snake	The kanji carries the abstract sense of the <b>self</b>, the deep-down inner structure of the human person that mythology has often depicted as a <i>snake</i> - which is what the kanji shows pictographically. Be sure to keep it distinct from the similar keywords, <i>oneself</i> (frame 36) and <i>I</i> (frame 17).	As a primitive element, this kanji can be used for the <i>snake</i> - of which it is a pictograph - or any of the various concrete symbolic meanings the <i>snake</i> has in myth and fable.	已

# add comment
已	stop, halt, previously, already, long ago			stop short	stop short		This character can be kept distinct from the familiar sign of the snake 巳 (1.2042) by noting that the final stroke stops short. [3]	Editor's note: Also keep distinct from kanji 己 self (which has also primitive meaning of 'snake').	已

# fix tiger primitives 虍 to 虎
虎	tiger, drunkard	虍	卜厂儿	tiger	tiger		The kanji in this frame recalls the famous Bengali fable about the group of magicians (the <i>magic wand</i>) who decided to make a <b>tiger</b>. It seems that each of them knew how to make one part of the beast, so they pooled their talents and brought all the pieces (<i>diced</i> into pieces) together, at which point the fabricated <i>tiger</b> promptly ate its makers up (the bodiless <i>human legs</i>). Whatever the parable's significance for modern civilization and its arsenals, it should help with this kanji. Oh yes, we should not forget that cliff-like element. Think of it as an abbreviation of the primitive for <i>zoo</i> (the first and fourth strokes, actually), in order to fit the <b>tiger</b> somewhere into the picture. In fact, the abbreviation is perfectly logical, since the bottom elements usurp the room for the rest of the primitive for <i>zoo</i>.	As a primitive element itself, the <i>human legs</i> are also swallowed up, but the meaning of <i>tiger</i> is kept, and the whole serves as a roof for what comes beneath 虍, giving the <i>tiger</i> something else to eat.	卜儿匕厂虍

喩	metaphor, compare	喻	口亼刖	metaphor	metaphor		People who try to sound literary often end up butchering the language. Here we see a <i>meeting</i> of <i>butchers</i> whose <i>mouths</i> are producing the <b>metaphors</b>.		刂月口𠆢

# fix primitive 
升	measuring box, 1.8 liter		人千十	measuring box	measuring box		This is the character for the little wooden box that the Japanese use for measuring things, as well as for drinking saké out of. Simply imagine the outside as spiked with a <i>thousand</i> sharp <i>needles</i>, and the quaint little <b>measuring box</b> becomes a drinker's nightmare! Be very careful when you write this character not to confuse it with the writing of <i>thousand</i>. The reason for the difference gives us a chance to clarify another general principle of writing that supersedes the one we mentioned in frame 4: when a single stroke runs vertically through the middle of a character, it is writ<i>ten</i> last.	Editor's note: The stroke order of <i>thousand</i> 千 doesn't actually match this character, but person 亻 should be used instead. ノ + 廾 (two hands) do not match either. 	ノ廾十

# fix primitives
憂	melancholy, grieve, lament, be anxious, sad, unhappy		頁冖心夂	melancholy	melancholy		<i>Head</i> . . . <i>crown</i> . . . <i>heart</i> . . . <i>walking legs</i>. Two things merit mention here. First, the doubling-up of the last stroke of <i>head</i> with the top of the <i>crown</i> serves to make the whole more aesthetically beautiful. It happens so rarely that the exceptions are easily learned. Second, try to make a single image out of the four elements. (Religious statuary of <b>melancholy</b> figures should offer plenty of suggestions.)	Editor's note: Notice how also the 'animal legs' ハ from the 'head' 頁 primitive are replaced with walking legs 夂 	一自心冖夂白
氏	family name, surname, clan		丶丿乙一乙	family name	family name		Pay close attention to the stroke order of the elements when learning to write this character. The elements: a long <i>drop</i> . . . <i>fishhook</i> . . . a <i>one</i> . . . <i>fishhook</i>.		氏
矢	dart, arrow		丿丶天	dart	dart		When shot high into the <i>heavens</i>, the <b>dart</b> gets so small it looks like a mere <i>drop</i>. Although this character could as well mean "arrow," it has no connection with the primitive of that meaning. Hence the new key word.		ノ大一矢
共	together, both, neither, all, and, alike, with		龷ハ	together	together		<i>Salad</i> . . . <i>animal legs</i>.	The primitive retains the meaning of <i>together</i>. Imagine things <i>strung together</i> like fish on a line, beads on a thread, or whatever. The main thing is to avoid putting them in a straight row, which would confound this element with the previous one. As we saw with <i>bushel basket</i>, this primitive can join its legs to the final horizontal stroke and stretch them to form an enclosure.	ハ｜一二

###### 丿 'katana' primitive
丿	katakana no radical (no. 4)					katana	This is a non-Heisig primitive, added as a reference to those kanjis which contain one stroke such as this and in which Heisig doesn't explicitely state it should be a 'drop' ( 丶 )primitive.	As a primitive let's use this as a pictograph of a 'katana' (japanese sword)	ノ

丰	abundant, lush, bountiful, plenty, fat face, luxurious growth of grass	[bushes-side]				bushes	Whatever image you contrived for the character meaning hedge (FRAME 154 垣), choose something different and clearly distinguishable for this primitive for <b>bushes</b>. The element itself differs from that for grow up only in the extension of the single vertical stroke beneath the final horizontal stroke and in the order of writing. Though we shall meet only one instance of it in this chapter and one more later on, it is worth noting that when this element appears on the side, the final stroke is sloped somewhat to the left: [bushes-side]. [4]		一｜二
艮	northeast (Oriental zodiac), stopping, good radical (no. 138)	[silver-left]				silver	We give this element the meaning of <b>silver</b> from the kanji in the following FRAME. Both the original pictographic representation and the primitive elements that make it up are more trouble to hunt out than they are worth. It is best simply to learn it as is. In doing so, take careful note of the stroke order, and also the fact that when this element appears on the left, the penultimate stroke is omitted, giving us simply [silver-left]. [6]		艮
匚	box-on-side enclosure radical (no. 22)	[box-small]				box, hook	This enclosure, open at the right, represents a <b>box</b> lying on its side. When it is not used as an enclosure, its form is cramped to look like this: [box-small]. You may distinguish its meaning by picturing it then as a very small <b>box</b>. [2]		匚
