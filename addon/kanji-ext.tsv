########### Primitives with missing Heisig stories and comments
### Most of the comment are moved from the entries of the first kanjis that refer to them
丨	number one, line, rod radical (no. 2)	ノ				stick	This primitive element is a picture of just what it looks like: a cane or <b>walking stick</b>. It carries with it the connotations of lameness and whatever else one associates with the use of a cane. Rarely—but very rarely—it will be laid on its side. Whenever this occurs, it will always be driven through the middle of some other primitive element. In this way, you need not worry about confusing it with the primitive meanings of <i>one</i>. [1]		｜
卜	divining, fortune-telling, divination or katakana to radical (no. 25)			augury		magic wand, divining rod	This is a picture of a <b>divining rod</b>, composed of a <i>drop</i> and a <i>walking stick</i>, but easy enough to remember as a pictograph. Alternately, you can think of it as a <b>magic wand</b>. In either case, it should suggest images of magic or fortune-telling. Nowadays it is written in the stroke order given here when it appears as a primitive, but until recently the order was often reversed (in order to instill correct habits for more stylized calligraphy). [2]	Although it falls outside of the list of general-use kanji, this element is actually a kanji in its own right, having virtually the same meaning as the kanji in the next frame.	卜
ハ						animal legs	Like the four that follow it, this primitive is not a kanji in its own right, though it is said to be derived from 八, the character we learned earlier for eight. It always comes at the bottom of the primitive to which it is related. It can mean the <b>legs</b> of any kind of animal: from a grizzly bear’s paws to an octopus’s tentacles to the spindle shanks of a spider. (The one animal not allowed is our friend homo sapiens, whose legs figure in the next frame.) Even where the term legs will apply metaphorically to the legs of pieces of furniture, it is best to keep the association with <b>animal legs</b>. (You may review frame 6 here.) [2]		
儿	legs radical (no. 10)					human legs	Notice how these <b>human legs</b> are somewhat shapelier and more highly evolved than those of the so-called “lower animals.” The one on the left, drawn first, is straight; while the one on the right bends gracefully and ends with a hook. Though they are not likely to suggest the legs of any human you know, they do have something of the look of someone out for a stroll, especially if you compare them to <i>animal legs</i>. If you had any trouble with the kanji for the number four, now would be the time to return to it (frame 4). [2]		儿
几	table, table enclosure, table or windy radical (no. 16)					wind	This primitive gets its name from the full kanji for the <b>wind</b> (frame 524). It is called an “enclosure” because other elements are often drawn in the middle of it, though it can also be compressed together so that there is no room for anything in it. The main thing to remember when writing this element is that the second stroke bends outwards, like a gust of <b>wind</b> blown from above. In addition to the basic meaning of <b>wind</b>, we shall also have occasion to use the image of a weather vane. The derivation is obvious. [2]		几
勹	wrapping enclosure, wrapping radical (no. 20)	⺈				bound up	Like wind, the element meaning <b>bound up</b> is also an enclosure that can wrap itself around other elements or be compressed when there is nothing to enclose. When this latter happens— usually because there is not enough room—and it is set on top, the little hook at the end is dropped off, like this: ⺈. The sense of <b>bound up</b> is that of being “tied and gagged” or wrapped up tightly. If you have trouble remembering when it serves as an enclosure (with the hook) and when not (without the hook), you might think of the former as a chain and the latter as a rope. [2]		勹
丷						animal horns	This primitive element always appears at the top of the element to which it is related, and is always attached, or almost attached, to the first horizontal line to come under it. The horns can never simply be left hanging in the air. When there is no line available, an extra horizontal stroke (like a one) is added. The final kanji of this lesson gives an example. The meaning of this element is wide enough to embrace the horns of bulls, rams, billy goats, and moose, but not the family of musical instruments. As with other elements with such “open” meanings, it is best to settle on one that you find most vivid and stick with that image consistently. [2]		
畐	to fill, roll of cloth		一口田			wealth	To prepare for following frame, we introduce here a somewhat rare primitive meaning <b>wealth</b>. It takes its meaning from the common image of the over<b>wealth</b>y as overfed. More specifically, the kanji shows us <i>one</i> single <i>mouth</i> devouring all the harvest of the <i>fields</i>, presumably while those who labor in them go hungry. Think of the phrase exactly as it is written when you draw the character, and the disposition of the elements is easy. [9]		一口田
宀	shaped crown, katakana u radical (no. 40)					house	This extremely useful primitive element depicts the roof of a <b>house</b>. You can see the chimney at the top and the eaves on either side without much trouble. It is a “crown” element, which means that it is invariably set atop other things. Examples follow immediately. [3]		宀
莫	must not, do not, be not		艹日大	shalt	shalt	graveyard	The element shown here should be taken to represent a modern <b>graveyard</b>. Gone are the cobwebs and gnarled trees, the tilted headstones and dark, moonless nights that used to scare the wits out of our childhood imaginations. Instead, we see brightly colored <i>flowers</i> placed before the tombstones, the <i>sun</i> shining gloriously overhead, and a cuddly <i>St. Bernard</i> sitting at the gate keeping watch. [10]		大日⺾
攵	strike, hit, folding chair radical variant (no. 66)					taskmaster	First find the long rod (the first stroke), held in the hand of someone seated (the next 3 strokes, not unlike the pictograph for <i>woman</i>, but quite different from that for <i>walking legs</i> introduced in Lesson 13). The only thing left to do is conjure up the memory of some <b>taskmaster</b> (or taskmistress) from your past whom you will “never forget.” [4]		攵
夂	late, delayed, winter radical (no. 34)					walking legs	We call this element <b>walking legs</b> because it indicates “legs in motion,” whether you want to think of them as jogging or walking in long strides, as the shape seems to suggest. Be careful how you write it, with the first two strokes like a stylized “7.” [3]		夂攵
冖	wa-shaped crown radical (no. 14)						This pictograph of a simple <b>crown</b> is distinguished from the roof only by the absence of the chimney (the first <i>drop</i> at the top). It can be used for all the principal connotations of the word <b>crown</b>. We will meet the full character from which this element is derived later on, in FRAME 326. [2]		冖
囗	box, box or enclosure radical (no. 31)					pent in	This primitive depicts a corral or pen surrounding something, which is thus <b>pent in</b>. [3]		囗口
# 亠 is NOT a roof!
亠	kettle lid radical (no. 8)					top hat	The broad rim and tall top of the <b>top hat</b> is pictured graphically here in these two simple strokes. At this point, by the way, you can revert back to FRAME 6. If you have had any trouble with that character, you now have the requisite elements to make a story: <b>Six</b> suggests the number of an ant’s <i>legs</i>; just set a tall silk <i>top hat</i> on the crawling creature and you have your character. [2]		亠

######### 癶 teepee primitive
癶	dotted tent radical (no. 105)					teepee	The dots at the top of this tent are the wooden poles protruding outside the canvas walls of a <b>teepee</b>. [5]		癶
登	ascend, climb up		癶豆	ascend	ascend		<i>Teepee</i> ... <i>table</i>. Do not confuse with rise up (FRAME 43). [12]		口豆并癶

######### 辶 road primitive
辶	walk, walking, road radical variant (no. 162)					road	The <b>road</b> envisioned here is a <b>road</b> for traffic, or a path or walkway. The natural sweep of these three simple strokes should be easy to remember, as it appears so often. [3]		辶
道	road-way, street, district, journey, course, moral, teachings		首辶	road-way	road-way		The key word carries both the sense of a <b>road</b> for transit and a <b>way</b> or method of doing something, but the former is better for forming an image. The primitives read: the <i>neck</i> of a <i>road</i>. Think of a crowded <b>road-way</b> where traffic has come to a standstill—what we commonly refer to as a “bottle<i>neck</i>.” [12]		辶自并首

####### 冂 hood primitive
冂	upside-down box radical (no. 13)					hood, glass canopy, belt	In addition to the basic meaning of <b>hood</b>, this shape can be used for a glass canopy, such as that used to serve “pheasant under glass.” Note its difference from the element for wind: the second stroke is hooked inwards here. To help remember this detail, think of the wind as blowing “out” and a <b>glass canopy</b> as keeping something “in.” Among the related images suggested by this primitive are: a monk’s cowl, a riding <b>hood</b>, a helmet, and an automobile <b>hood</b>. [2]	Editor's note: This primitive is used for both <b>hood</b> and <b>belt</b>. The only difference is that the former is used for encompassing other primitives (like in '<i>同 same</i>') whereas the latter is used when it goes through other primitives (such as in '<i>刺 thorn</i>')	冂
刺	thorn, pierce, stab, prick, sting, calling card		木冂刀	thorn	thorn		<b>Thorns</b> grow on a bush here that has wrapped itself around a <i>tree</i> like a <i>belt</i>, cutting into the poor <i>tree</i> like little <i>sabers</i>. [8]		｜刂巾ハ木亅冂

######## 亢 whirlwind primitive
亢	high spirits		亠几			whirlwind	A formal high silk <i>top hat</i> resting atop a weather vane represents a <b>whirlwind</b>. To keep it distinct from the primitive for <i>wind</i>, try to picture the vortex, or tornado-like spinning movement, of a <b>whirlwind</b>. The next frame should help. [4]		亠几
坑	pit, hole		土亢	pit	pit		A <i>whirlwind</i> begins to dig its way into the <i>soil</i> like a drill until it makes a deep <b>pit</b>. [7]		土亠几

######## 云 rising cloud primitive
云	say			quote	quote	rising cloud	This primitive is meant to depict in graphic fashion a <b>cloud</b> of something <b>rising</b> upwards, like vapor or smoke or dust. [4]		一二厶
転	revolve, turn around, change		車云	revolve	revolve		As the wheels of the <i>car</i> <b>revolve</b>, they kick up small <i>rising clouds</i> of dust and debris behind them. [11]		車二厶

####### 'stretch' radical
廴	long stride or stretching radical (no. 54)					stretch	The primitive meaning to <b>stretch</b> might at first seem similar to that for road. Take a moment to study it more carefully and you will see the difference. Like road, this character holds other primitives above its sweeping final stroke. [3]		廴
建	build		聿廴	build	build		To construct a <b>build</b>ing, you first draw a set of plans (the writing <i>brush</i>) and then s-t-r-e-t-c-h your drawing out to scale in reality. [9] 		廴聿

######### 丶 'drop of' primitive
# switch primitive from 丿 to 丶 when it is clearly a 'drop'. Otherwise list both
丶	dot, tick or dot radical (no. 3)					drop	The meaning of this primitive is obvious from the first moment you look at it, though just what it will be a <b>drop</b> of will differ from case to case. The important thing is not to think of it as something insignificant like a <b>“drop</b> in the bucket” but as something so important that it can change the whole picture— like a <b>drop</b> of arsenic in your mother-in-law’s coffee. [1]	In general, it is written from right to left, but there are times when it can be slanted left to right. At other times it can be stretched out a bit: ノ. (In cases where you have trouble remembering this, it may help to think of it as an eyedropper dripping drops of something or other.) Examples will follow in this lesson.	丶
少	few, little		小丶丿	few	few		First we need to look at the fourth stroke, the <i>drop</i> at the bottom that has been extended into a longer diagonal stroke leaning left. This happens because a single, isolated <i>drop</i> will NEVER appear beneath its relative primitive in its normal size, for fear it would <i>drop</i> off and get lost. As for the meaning, let the tiny <i>drop</i> indicate a further belittling of what is already <i>little</i> - thus making it a <b>few</b> of something <i>little</i>.		ノ小
失	lose, error, fault, disadvantage, loss		丶丿夫	lose	lose	to drop	"To <b>lose</b>" here takes the sense of "misplace," not the sense of <i>defeat</i>, whose kanji we learned in frame 67. It pictures a <i>husband</i> with something falling from his side as he is walking along, something he <b>loses</b>.	As a primitive, this character can also mean <b>to drop</b>.	ノ人二大
血	blood		丶皿	blood	blood		The <i>drop</i> in the <i>dish</i> is <b>blood</b>. It is similar to the <i>drop</i> we saw earlier on the <i>dagger</i> in the character for <i>blade</i> (Frame 88).		血皿
風	wind, air, style, manner		几丶虫	wind	wind		<i>Windy</i> . . . <i>drops of</i> . . . <i>insects</i>. Hint: think of the last two primitives as representing a swarm of <i>gnats</i>, those tiny <i>drops of</i> pesky <i>insects</i>.		風冂虫ノ
奥	heart, interior		丶冂米大	core	core		<i>A drop</i> . . . <i>pent in</i> . . . <i>rice</i> . . . <i>St. Bernard dog</i>. Notice that the horizontal line of the bottom primitive doubles up as the final stroke for <i>pent in</i>.		大米冂
鬼	ghost, devil		丶田儿厶	ghost	ghost		<i>Drop</i> of . . . <i>brain</i>s . . . <i>human legs</i> . . . <i>elbow</i>.		鬼田儿匕厶
午	noon, sign of the horse, 11AM-1PM, seventh sign of Chinese zodiac		丿干	noon	noon		With a bit of stretching, you might see a horse's head pointing leftwards in this character. That gives the primary meaning of the Chinese zodiacal sign of the horse, which corresponds to the hour of <b>noon</b>. Note how this kanji primitive differs from that for <i>cow</i> (Frame 260).	As a primitive, this character gets the meaning of a <i>horse</i>. Any <i>horse</i> image will do, except that of a <i>team of horses</i>, which will come later (Frame 2132) and get its own primitive.	ノ干十
系	lineage, system		丿糸	lineage	lineage	yam	The single stroke added to the beginning of the primitive for <i>thread</i> gives the image of <i>thread</i>s woven into a single cord. Hence the meaning, <b>lineage</b>.	As a primitive, we shall give this kanji the meaning of <i>yarn</i>, as the uniting of many <i>thread</i>s into a single strand is most obvious with <i>yarn</i>.	ノ糸幺小
呂	spine, backbone		口丿丶口	spine	spine		This character is rather like a picture of two of the vertebrae in the <b>spine</b> linked by a single stroke.		口
属	belong, genus, subordinate official, affiliated		尸丿丶虫冂	belong	belong	genius	<i>Flag</i> . . . <i>gnats</i> (see frame 563) . . . with a <i>belt</i>.		ノ尸禸
乏	destitution, scarce, limited		丿丶之	destitution	destitution		<i>Drop</i> <i>of</i> . . . <i>building blocks</i>.		ノ乙丶亠
朱	vermilion, cinnabar, scarlet, red, bloody		丿丶未	vermilion	vermilion		That red-orange color we call <b>vermilion</b> is found in nature during the fall when the leaves lose their sugar and begin to change color. This kanji depicts the very last leaf on a tree in the fall (the <i>drop</i> hung in the first stroke), the leaf that has <i>not yet</i> fallen as it one day must. Look at its color - <b>vermilion</b>. (Well, not really. The truth is, <b>vermilion</b> is made from a mercuric sulfide, but I'm sure you will agree that autumn leaves area lot easier to work with.)		｜ノ牛二ハ木
升	measuring box, 1.8 liter		亻千十	measuring box	measuring box		This is the character for the little wooden box that the Japanese use for measuring things, as well as for drinking saké out of. Simply imagine the outside as spiked with a <i>thousand</i> sharp <i>needles</i>, and the quaint little <b>measuring box</b> becomes a drinker's nightmare! Be very careful when you write this character not to confuse it with the writing of <i>thousand</i>. The reason for the difference gives us a chance to clarify another general principle of writing that supersedes the one we mentioned in frame 4: when a single stroke runs vertically through the middle of a character, it is writ<i>ten</i> last.	Editor's note: The stroke order of <i>thousand</i> 千 doesn't actually match this character, but person 亻 should be used instead. ノ + 廾 (two hands) do not match either. 	ノ廾十

########### Add primitive alternative for 'ice'
冫	two-stroke water radical or ice radical (no. 15)	⺀					The condensation of the three drops we have been using to mean <i>water</i> into two drops signals the solidifying of <i>water</i> into <b>ice</b>. Note that when this primitive appears to the left, it is written like the last two strokes of the element for <i>water</i>, 冫, whereas under another primitive, it is written like the first two strokes of the water primitive: ⺀. [2]		冫
冬	winter		夂冫	winter	winter		<i>Walking legs</i> slipping on the <i>ice</i> are a sure sign of <b>winter</b>. [5]		夂丶攵

######### 啇 antique primitive
啇	the stalk, the stem, the foot, the base		立冂古			antique	The primitive meaning <b>antique</b>, not itself a kanji, depicts a <i>vase</i> kept under a <i>glass hood</i> because it is very, very <i>old</i>. [11]		亠并冂十口
嫡	legitimate wife, direct descent (non-bastard)		女啇	legitimate wife	legitimate wife		The phrase <b>legitimate wife</b> would have no meaning if there were not such a thing as an “il<b>legitimate wife</b>,” taken because one’s legal <i>woman</i> has turned into an <i>antique</i>. The very offense of the idea should help you remember the kanji. [14]		口十女并立亠冂滴

######## 𠂉 reclining primitive
### This is NOT a 'man' primitive !!
𠂉						lying down, reclining	The picture is obvious: the first stroke represents the head, and the second the body of someone <b>reclining</b>. You may also use the synonyms <i>lying</i> or <i>lying down</i>. [2]		一ノ
毎	every		𠂉母	every	every		“Behind <b>every</b> successful person <i>lies</i> a woman...,” who usually turns out to be one’s <i>mama</i>! [6]		母毋

###### ⺶ wool primitive
⺶			羊			wool	This rather uncommon primitive is made by pulling the tail of the <i>sheep</i> to one side to create a semi-enclosure. The meaning of <b>wool</b> is derived from the fact that the shearer is holding the <i>sheep</i> by the tail in order to trim its <b>wool</b>. [7]		一ノ
着	don, arrive, wear, counter for suits of clothing		⺶目	don	don		I cannot resist doing this one for you, since it clearly describes <b>donning</b> (putting on) one's clothes as "pulling the <i>wool</i> over one's <i>eyes</i>."		ノ王并目羊
差	distinction, difference, variation, discrepancy, margin, balance		⺶工	distinction	distinction		<i>Wool</i> ... <i>craft</i>. [10]		ノ王工并羊
羞	feel ashamed		⺶丑	humiliate	humiliate		<i>Wool</i> . . <i>sign of the cow</i>.		ノヨ王并羊

######## 广 cave primitive
广	dotted cliff radical (no. 53)		厂			cave	This primitive combines the <i>cliff</i> (the last 2 strokes) with the first dot we use on the roof of the <i>house</i>. Together they make a “cliff house” or cave. It “encloses” its relative primitives beneath it and to the right. [3]		广
店	store, shop		广占	store	store		<i>Cave</i> ... <i>fortune-telling</i>. [8]		口卜广

######## 手 hand primitive
### Even though 手 has a alternate primitive form of 扌(fingers), we keep the 扌 as a separate entity
手	hand	扌		hand	hand		Any way you count them, there are either too many or too few <b>fingers</b> to see a good pictograph of a <b>hand</b> in this character. But that it is, and so you must.	Keep to the etymology when using this kanji as a primitive: a single <i>hand</i> all by itself. The alternate form of the primitive for <b>hand</b> (扌) we shall use to represent finger or <b>fingers</b>. It always appears at the left. [3]	手
抹	rub, paint, erase		手末	rub	rub		<i>Fingers</i> ... <i>extremity</i>. [8]		｜一ハ木亠扌


######## 扌 hand primitive
### Even though 手 has a alternate primitive form of 扌(fingers), we keep the 扌 as a separate entity as Heisig intended
扌	hand, hand radical (no. 64)					finger, fingers	The alternate form of the primitive for <b>hand</b> (手) we shall use to represent <b>finger</b> or <b>fingers</b>. It always appears at the left. [3]

押	push, stop, check, subdue, attach, seize, weight, shove, press, seal, do in spite of		扌甲	push	push		<i>Fingers</i> . . . <i>roots</i>. Compare and contrast with <i>pluck</i> (Frame 1187).		｜日扌田

########## 开 two hands primitive
开	open, initiate, begin, start					two hands	Let this primitive represent a union of <b>two hands</b>, both of which are used at the same time. Whenever this element appears at the bottom of its relative primitive, the top line is omitted, whether or not there is a horizontal line to replace it. [4]		一ノ十干廾
研	polish, study of, sharpen		石开	polish	polish		<i>Stone</i> ... <i>two hands</i>. [9]		｜口石亅廾ノ

####### 曼 mandala primitive
曼	wide, beautiful		日罒又	mandala	mandala		<i>Sun</i> ... <i>eye</i> ... <i>crotch</i>. [11]		日罒又
慢	ridicule, laziness		心曼	ridicule	ridicule		<i>State of mind</i> ... <i>mandala</i>. [14]		日罒忄又

########## [arm] primitive
[arm]						tucked under the arm	The picture of an <b>arm</b> dangling from the trunk of the body gives us the element for <b>arm</b>, or <b>tucked under the arm</b> (relative to the element below it). Examples of both usages follow. Unlike most primitives, the kanji that bears the same meaning (FRAME 1522) has absolutely no connection with it. [2]		
丈	length, ten shaku, measure, Mr., Ms., height, stature, all (one has), only, that's all, merely		丈	length	length		The <b>length</b> whose measure this kanji depicts extends from the tip of one hand to the tip of the other with <i>arms</i> at full <b>length</b>. Notice the final stroke, which cuts across the vertical second stroke to distinguish it from <i>large</i> (FRAME 112). [3] 		ノ一丶
史	history, chronicle		口[arm]	history	history		A <i>mouth</i> . . . <i>tucked under the arm</i>.		ノ口
更	grow late, night watch, sit up late, of course, renew, renovate, again, more and more, further		一日[arm]	grow late	grow late		The implication behind the meaning of <b>grow late</b> is that things are changing in the same way that the <i>day</i> turns into night. The elements: <i>ceiling</i> . . . <i>sun</i> . . . <i>tucked under the arm</i>.		ノ一日
吏	officer, an official		一史口[arm]	officer	officer		<i>One</i> . . . <i>mouth</i> . . . <i>tucked under the arm</i>.		ノ一口丶
匁	monme, 3.75 grams, (kokuji)		勹[arm]	monme	monme		This character obliges us once again to make use of a Japanese key word for want of an English equivalent. It refers to an old unit of weight, equal to about 3.75 grams. The word is only slightly more useful in modern Japanese than cubits and kites are in modern English. Its primitives, if you look closely, are: <i>bound up</i> . . . <i>arm</i>.		ノ勹丶

# 乂 sheaf is NOT an 'arm' !
乂	mow, cut grass, subdue					sheaf			ノ


####### 孚 fledglings primitive
孚	sincere, nourish, encase		爪子			fledglings	The <b>vulture</b> and <b>child</b> combine to create the image of an aerie full of <b>fledglings</b>. [7]		子爪
乳	milk, breasts		孚乙	milk	milk		<i>Fledglings</i> ... hook. [8]		乙子爪

######## 厶 elbow primitive
厶	I, myself, katakana mu radical (no. 28)					elbow	This pictograph of an arm bent at the <b>elbow</b> is obvious. [2]		厶
払	pay, clear out, prune, banish, dispose of		扌厶	pay	pay		<i>Finger</i> ... <i>elbow</i>. [5]		厶扌

####### 禾 wheat primitive
禾	two-branch tree radical (no. 115)					grain, wheat, cereal	This primitive element will be made to stand for <b>wheat</b>. It connotes a special <b>grain</b>, more expensive than ordinary rice and so reserved for special occasions. Alternatively, it can mean <b>cereal</b>. Its form is like that for tree, except for the dot at the top to represent a spike of <b>wheat</b> blowing in the wind. [5]		禾木ノ
稿	draft, copy, manuscript, straw		禾高	draft	draft		The key word connotes the preliminary composition of a plan or manuscript. Its elements: <i>wheat</i> ... <i>tall</i>. [15]		禾口高亠冂

###### 从 assembly line
从	two people		人			assembly line	The duplication of the kanji for <i>person</i> gives us this primitive for <b>assembly line</b>. Perhaps you can imagine clones of your chosen <i>person</i> rolling off an <b>assembly line</b> in a factory. [4]		人
座	squat, seat, cushion, gathering, sit		广坐从土	sit	sit		<i>Cave</i> ... <i>assembly line</i> ... <i>soil</i>. [10]		｜土人广

###### 并 puzzle
并	put together		丷开			puzzle	Think of this element as a picture <b>puzzle</b> in which the pieces interlock. Its elements: <i>horns</i> ... <i>two hands</i>. [6]		ノ干二并
併	join, get together, unite, collective		人并	join	join		The sense of the key word is one of <b>joining</b> things together that were previously separate. Its elements: <i>person</i> ... <i>puzzle</i>. [8]		｜ノ一⺅二并廾

###### 敝 shredder
敝	be worn-out, be dilapidated, be defeated		小冂小攵			shredder	The element on the left looks like <i>rice</i> with a <i>belt</i> running through it, but we would do best to think of it in terms of its writing order: <i>little</i> ... <i>belt</i> ... <i>little</i>. On the right, of course, the <i>taskmaster</i>. [12]		｜巾⺌并冂攵
幣	cash, bad habit, humble prefix, gift, Shinto offerings of cloth, rope, cut paper		敝巾	cash	cash		<i>Shredder</i> ... <i>towel</i>. [15]		巾并冂攵

######## 尸 flag
尸	corpse, remains, flag radical (no. 44)					flag	The pictographic representation of this element is obvious. Provided you can hold your imagination in check for the first example, you might best imagine your own national <b>flag</b> in composing your stories. [3]		尸
尿	urine		尸水	urine	urine		<i>Flag</i> ... <i>water</i>. [7]		水尸


###########  ヨ broom primitive
ヨ						broom	The pictographic representation here is of the bristles on the head of a <b>broom</b>. Note that the second stroke stops short without cutting through the second. [3]		
雪	snow		雨ヨ	snow	snow		<i>Rain</i> that undergoes a change so that it can be swept aside with a <i>broom</i> is <b>snow</b>. [11]		ヨ雨


######## 尹 mop
尹	an official rank					mop	The only thing distinguishing a <b>mop</b> from a <i>rake</i> is the bent handle that does not cut through the top horizontal stroke. It depicts the swish-swash motion of a <b>mop</b>. [4]		ノヨ一
伊	Italy, that one		人尹	Italy	Italy		Used chiefly in proper names, and given the sound “i,” this kanji can be remembered as an abbreviation of <b>Italy</b>, for which it is still used today in Japan. Its primitives: <i>person</i> ... <i>mop</i>. [6]		｜ヨ⺅

######## 而 comb
而	and yet, and then, but, however, nevertheless			and then	and then	comb	The pictograph of a <b>comb</b> is clearly visible in this primitive element. [6]		而
耐	-proof, enduring		而寸	proof	-proof		The key word is a suffix used to indicate “safe from” or “protected against,” as in the words rust<b>proof</b>, water<b>proof</b>, and fire<b>proof</b>. It is composed of: <i>comb</i> ... <i>glue</i>. [9]		而寸

########## 凵 shovel
凵	open box enclosure, open box radical (no. 17)					shovel	This enclosure—which embraces its relative primitive from the bottom—is a pictograph of the scoop of a <b>shovel</b>. When room permits, the arms are extended upwards to nearly the same height as the relative element it holds. [2]		凵
両	both, old Japanese coin, counter for carriages (e.g., in a train), two		一冂山	both	both		<i>Ceiling</i> ... <i>belt</i> ... <i>mountain</i>. Note that the writing order follows the order in which the primitives are given here. [6]		｜一冂山

###### 卉 haystack
卉	grass					haystack	The three <i>needles</i> stacked up give us a <b>haystack</b> (in which it may be harder to find the hay than the needles). In the rare case in which there is nothing underneath this element, as in the following frame, the last three strokes are written virtually the same as two hands—that is, the second stroke sweeps down slightly to the left. [5]		十廾
奔	run, bustle		大卉	bustle	bustle		The hustle and <b>bustle</b> of this character is depicted by a <i>St. Bernard dog</i> and a <i>haystack</i>. [8]		ノ一十大廾

######## 尭 straw man
尭	high, far			lofty		straw man	The two <i>human legs</i> added to the <i>haystack</i> (with the horizontal stroke to keep the two parts distinct from one another and avoid an ugly tangle) give us a <b>straw man</b>. [8]		十儿廾一
焼	bake, burning		火尭	bake	bake		<i>Hearth</i> ... <i>straw man</i>. Take care to distinguish this kanji from cook (FRAME 507) and burn (FRAME 549) when you compose your story. [12]		火十儿


####### 蒸 steam
蒸	steam, heat, sultry, foment, get musty		艹丞了水火	steam	steam		The <i>flower</i> at the top and the <i>floor</i> with the <i>oven fire</i> beneath are familiar. The problem is what comes in between. It is formed by the character for <i>complete</i>, whose vertical stroke doubles up as the first stroke of <i>water</i>.		ノ一亅灬⺾
極	poles, settlement, conclusion, end, highest rank, electric poles, very, extremely, most, highly, 10**48		木亟丂口又一	poles	poles		The <b>poles</b> this key word refers to are the extremities of the earth or the terminals of an electric field. The elements are: <i>tree</i> . . . <i>snare</i> . . . <i>mouth</i> . . . <i>crotch</i> . . . <i>floor</i>.		口又木一

######### 釆 animal tracks
釆	separate, divide, topped rice radical (no. 165)		丶米			animal tracks	Having already met the primitive for human <i>footprints</i>, we now introduce the one for <b>animal tracks</b>. Its elements are　simply: a <i>drop</i> of ... <i>rice</i>. [7]		釆米
釈	explanation		釆尺	explanation	interpretation		<i>Animal tracks</i> ... <i>shaku</i>hachi. [11]		釆米尸丶

########## 毛 fur 
毛	fur, hair, feather, down		手	fur	fur		This character simply reverses the direction of the final stroke of <i>hand</i> (手) to produce <b>fur</b>. If you reverse your <i>hand</i> and put its palm down, you will have the side on which <b>fur</b> grows.		毛
乇	to depend on, to entrust with		毛			lock of hair	This element is clearly derived from that for <i>fur</i> (毛). By leaving out the second stroke, we get simply a <b>lock of hair</b>. [3]		一ノ乙
宅	home, house, residence, our house, my husband		宀乇	home	home		<i>House</i> ... <i>lock of hair</i>. [6] 		ノ一乙宀

####### 爰 migrating ducks
爰	lead on to, therefore, then		爪一友			migrating ducks	This primitive is simplicity itself. It depicts bird <i>claw</i>s that are joined to <i>one</i> another. Note the extra horizontal stroke in <i>friend</i>ship, which gives the appearance of a "two" in the middle of the kanji, further emphasizing the togetherness of the <b>migrating ducks</b>. [9]		ノ一爪又
暖	warmth		日爰	warmth	warmth		Unlike the connotation of <i>warm</i> weather learned for an earlier key word, (FRAME 1560), this key word will be used to refer to the <b>warmth</b> of human congeniality. Its elements are: <i>sun</i> ... <i>migrating ducks</i>. [13] 		ノ一爪日又

###### 屰 mountain goat
屰	disobedient		丷山			disobey, mountain goat	The <i>animal horns</i> and <i>mountain</i> unite, quite naturally, to give us a <b>mountain goat</b>. The extension of the final stroke indicates its tail, which only shows up when it has something under it. In an overhead enclosure, it is to be pictured as standing still, so that its tail droops down and out of sight. [6]		一并屮
逆	inverted, reverse, opposite, wicked		屰辶	inverted	inverted		<i>mountain goat</i>.. <i>road</i>. [9] 		辶并屮

######## 鬱 gloom
鬱	gloom, depression, melancholy, luxuriant		缶木木冖鬯乂丶凵匕彡	gloom	gloom		Learning this character will take a little doing. Before we start, it is a good idea to keep the key word distinct from <i>melancholy</i> (Frame 663), with which it combines to create the psychological condition of depression (a metaphor based on the hollow or sinking of the material <i>depression</i> we met in Frame 1421). The picture of <b>gloom</b> begins with a small <i>grove</i> of <i>tree</i>s, under which we see a <i>crown</i> made out of used <i>tin cans</i>. Next (the lower half of the kanji) we find a combination that appears only a few times in modern characters and only once in those treated in the volumes of <i>Remembering the Kanji</i>. It is composed of a <i>shovel</i> with a <i>sheaf</i> dotted with small <i>drops</i> on all sides. Think of it as a large scoop <i>shovel</i> attached to the front of a bulldozer, whose driver is singing: ♪ "Bulldozing in the <i>sheaves</i>, bulldozing in the <i>sheaves</i>..." ♪ The <i>drops</i> represent the chaff flying about as the <i>sheaves</i> are tossed about by the heavy machinery. There is <i>someone sitting on the ground</i> alongside, watching as the machinery makes its way around the neighboring farmland - and it's you, wearing your <i>tin-can crown</i>. You feel overwhelmed by the impending doom as the invasion of agro-business draws closer and closer to the <i>grove</i>, the only patch of woods that remains of what once was a vast forest. The whole scene represents a re-<i>shaping</i> of the natural environment that brings the heavy weight of <b>gloom</b> down upon you. A bit much, perhaps, but there are enough elements to allow for any number of other combinations.		缶木冖凵匕彡
鬯	fragrant herbs, spiced liqueur, grow, spread		乂丶凵匕						凵匕鬯


######## 豸 skunk
豸	snake, legless insect, badger or clawed dog radical (no. 153)		爪豕			skunk	This primitive represents a <b>skunk</b> by combining the <i>claw</i> with the first part of the element for a <i>sow</i>. Note how the final stroke of <i>claw</i> is turned and lengthened to double up with the first stroke of the <i>sow</i>. [7]		豸
懇	sociable, kind, courteous, hospitable, cordial		豸艮心	sociable	sociable		<i>Skunk</i> ... <i>silver</i> ... <i>heart</i>. [17] 		艮心爪犭豸



######### 夹 'scissors' primitive
夹			夫			scissors	This primitive is based on that for <i>husband</i>. The two extra strokes represent a pair of <b>scissors</b> he is carrying around. [6]		十廾
狭	cramped, narrow, contract, tight		犬夹	cramped	cramped		Pack of wild <i>dog</i>s . . . <i>scissors</i>.		人大二并犭丶亠
挟	pinch, between		扌夹	sandwiched	sandwiched		<i>Fingers</i> . . . <i>scissors</i>. Do not confuse with the kanji for <i>pinch</i> (Frame 709).		人大二并丶亠扌
頬	cheeks, jaw		夹頁	cheek	cheek		<i>Scissors</i> . . . <i>head</i>.		貝目ハ人頁二并
侠	tomboy, chivalry		人夹	chivalry	chivalry				⺅人大二并亠
峡	gorge, ravine		山夹	gorge	gorge		<i>Mountain</i> ... <i>scissors</i>. [9]		山人大二并亠

# this is not 'scissors' even though it resembles it a bit visually and semantically
夾	insert between								人大


######## 咼 jawbone primitive
咼	crooked mouth, evil, dishonest		口冂			jawbone	The meaning of this primitive is taken from the combination of “the joint” above and the <i>mouth</i> in the <i>cowl</i> below. [9]		口冂
禍	calamity, misfortune, evil, curse		示咼	calamity	calamity		<i>Altar</i> ... <i>jawbone</i>. [13]		口礻冂

########### 㓁 paper punch primitive
㓁	a net, net-like, radical 122		冖儿			paper punch	This primitive simply discards the first stroke of that for hole to become a <b>paper punch</b>. When found at the top of its relative primitive, it undergoes the same change, the <i>eight</i> becoming <i>human legs</i> (see FRAME 1413). [4]		儿冖
探	grope, search, look for		扌㓁木	grope	grope		<i>Fingers</i> ... <i>paper punch</i> ... <i>tree</i>. [11]		木儿冖扌

############# 辟 ketchup primitive
辟	false, punish, crime, law		尸口辛			ketchup	One way American children learn to cope with food they are forced to eat against their will is to smother it with <b>ketchup</b>. We can see this depicted in the <i>mouth</i> with the <i>flag</i> over it (in this case, the Stars and Stripes), set alongside the element for <i>spicy</i> (all of which is not far removed from the original meaning it had as a character on its own: “false”). [13]		口十辛立尸
壁	wall, lining (stomach), fence		辟土	wall	wall		<i>Ketchup</i> ... ground. [16]		口十辛土立尸

######### 丩 cornucopia primitive
丩	to join or connect the vine					cornucopia	Considering the lack of circular lines, this kanji is not a bad pictograph of a <b>cornucopia</b>. Despite the appearance of the printed form, what looks like the first two strokes are actually written as one. [2]		｜
叫	shout, exclaim, yell		口丩	shout	shout		<i>Mouth</i> ... <i>cornucopia</i>. [5]		｜口十
卑	lowly, base, vile, vulgar		丿丶田丩	lowly	lowly		A <i>drop</i> of . . . <i>brain</i>s . . . <i>cornucopia</i>.		十田
赳	strong and brave		走丩	bold	bold				｜走土

######## 朮 resin primitive
朮	a type of millet, a type of herb		木丶			resin	This <i>tree</i> has become a <i>pole</i> (that is, a <i>tree</i> with its branches not touching) because most of its branches have been pruned off by a naive but greedy gardener anxious to siphon off its <b>resin</b> (the <i>drop</i> at the top, written as the final stroke) as quickly as possible. [5]		｜一木丶儿
述	mention, state, speak, relate		朮辶	mention	mention		<i>Resin</i> ... <i>road</i>. [8]		辶十丶木


######### 于 potato primitive
于	going, from					potato	Note how this element differs from <i>dry</i> in virtue of the small hook at the end of the third stroke. [3]		二亅
芋	potato		艹于	potato	potato		<i>Flowers</i> ... <b>potato</b>. [6]		一⺾干

######## 疒 sickness primitive
疒	trailing sickness, sick radical (no. 104)		广冫			sickness	The enclosure shown in this FRAME is composed of a <i>cave</i> with <i>ice</i> outside of it. It is used for a number of kanji related to <b>sickness</b>. If you want to picture a <i>cave</i>man nursing a hangover with an <i>ice</i>-pack, that should provide enough help to remember the shape of this element and its meaning. [5]		疒
病	ill, sick		疒丙	ill	ill		<i>Sickness</i> ... <i>third class</i>. [10] 		一人冂疒

######### 复 double back primitive
复	return, repeat, repeatedly					double back	Either the idea of turning around and heading back during one’s travels, or of folding an object in half will do. The kanji depicts someone <b>doubling back</b> to the nearest inn to <i>lie down</i> and rest a weary pair of <i>walking legs</i> after a full <i>day’s</i> voyage. [9]		一ノ夂日
腹	abdomen, belly, stomach		月复	abdomen	abdomen		If you <i>double back</i> (fold over) most animals—or people, for that matter—in the middle, the <i>part of the body</i> where the crease comes is the <b>abdomen</b>. [13]		月日夂

######### 戠 kazoo
戠	sword, potter's clay, to gather		音戈			kazoo	This primitive’s special usefulness lies not in its frequency but in its simplification of a few otherwise difficult kanji. It pictures the <i>sound</i> of a <i>fiesta</i>, namely a <b>kazoo</b>. Note how the element for <i>sound</i> is written first, the fifth stroke extended so that it can be used in the element for <i>fiesta</i>. [12]		亠并戈日曰立
識	discriminating, know, write		言戠	discriminating	discriminating		A person of <b>discriminating</b> intellect can tell the difference between mere <i>kazoo</i>-buzzing and <i>words</i> spoken wisely. [19]		音言日立戈

######### 壬 porter
壬	9th calendar sign		丶士			porter	Let the extended dot at the top represent the load that the <i>samurai</i> is carrying in his role as the master’s <b>porter</b>. [4]		ノ士
妊	pregnancy		女壬	pregnancy	pregnancy		A <i>woman</i> who is in her <b>pregnancy</b> is a bit like a <i>porter</i>, bearing her new companion wherever she goes. [7]		ノ王士女

###### 豕 sow
豕	pig, hog, pig radical (no. 152)					sow	Let this primitive represent a fat <b>sow</b>. Easier than pulling it apart into smaller elements is remembering its shape as a highly stylized pictograph. Practice its 7 strokes a few times before going on to examples of its use in the next six frames. [7]		豕
豚	pork, pig		月豕	pork	pork		<i>Flesh</i> ... <i>sow</i>. [11]		月豕


######## 木 tree:  Add 'ホ wooden pole' alternative primitive
木	tree, wood	ホ	木	tree	tree		Here we see a pictograph of a <b>tree</b>, showing the main trunk in the long vertical stroke and the boughs in the long horizontal stroke. The final two strokes sweep down in both directions to indicate the roots. Although it may look similar at first sight to the kanji for <i>water</i> (Frame 137), the order in which it is written is completely different and this affects its final appearance.	As a primitive, this kanji can be used to mean <i>tree</i> or <i>wood</i>. In those cases where the last two strokes are detached from the trunk (ホ), we shall change its meaning to <i>pole</i>, or <i>wooden pole</i>.	木
茶	tea		艹𠆢木	tea	tea		As everyone knows, <b>tea</b> is made from <b>tea</b> leaves. But the <b>tea</b> plant itself has its own <i>flowers</i>, which can be quite beautiful and add a special flavor to the <i>tea</i>, as the Chinese found out already over 4,598 years ago. With the image of a terrace of <i>flowering</i> <b>tea</b> bushes in mind, picture a number of brightly painted and very l-o-n-g <i>wooden poles</i> (Frame 207) placed here and there in their midst, with a tiny <i>umbrella</i> at the top to shade the delicate-tasting <b>tea</b> <i>flowers</i>.		𠆢⺾木


########## 入 enter.  Add 'go in' primitive alternative, but use a separate svg to make it distinct entity from '八 eight' just like Heisig wanted..
入	enter, insert	[go_in]	入	enter	enter		This character is meant to be a picture of someone walking leftwards, putting one leg forward in order to <b>enter</b> someplace. Since the "in" side of a character is the left, it should be easy to remember the writing of this character.	As a primitive, the meaning of the key word is expanded to include: <i>to go in</i>, <i>to put in</i>, <i>to come in</i>, and the like. It generally appears atop its relative primitive, where, unlike the element for <i>umbrella</i>, the two strokes do not touch each other, making it virtually the same as the kanji for <i>eight</i>. When it appears in any other position, however, it retains its original form.	入
分	part, minute of time, segment, share, degree, one's lot, duty, understand, know, rate, 1%, chances, shaku/100		入刀	part	part		Go in . . . <i>dagger</i>.		刀ハ
谷	valley		入𠆢口	valley	valley		<i>Go in</i> . . . <i>an umbrella</i> . . . <i>a mouth</i>. Because of space restrictions, the element for <i>go in</i> is shortened in this character. If you stand on your head and look at this kanji, the image of a <b>valley</b> stands out more clearly: the <i>mouth</i> of the river whose water flows down at the intersection of the two mountains, with the final two strokes adding the element of perspective. Now get back on your feet again and see if the image still remains clear. If not, then return to the primitives and make a story in the usual way.		口谷ハ𠆢

# Remove 'go in' primitive alternative from 八 eight to keep it semantically separate
八	eight, eight radical (no. 12)		八	eight	eight		Just as the Arabic numeral "8" is composed of a small circle followed by a larger one, so the kanji for <b>eight</b> is composed of a short line followed by a longer line, slanting towards it but not touching it. And just as the "lazy 8" is the mathematical symbol for "infinity," so the expanse opened up below these two strokes is associated by the Japanese with the sense of an infinite expanse or something "all-encompassing."		ハ


###########  𠆢 'umbrella' primitive
𠆢						umbrella	The actual kanji on which this primitive meaning <b>umbrella</b> is based will not show up until FRAME 1103. Think of it as a large and brightly-colored beach <b>umbrella</b>. If you compare this with FRAME 8, you will notice how the two strokes touch here, while the kanji for eight would leave a gaping leak in the top. [2]		𠆢
全	whole, entire, all, complete, fulfill		𠆢王	whole	whole		<b>Wholeness</b> suggests physical and spiritual health, "having your act together." The kanji-image for <b>wholeness</b> depicts being "<i>king</i> under your own <i>umbrella</i>," that is, giving order to your own life. I know it sounds terribly abstract, but what could be more abstract than the word <b>whole</b>?		王ハ𠆢
食	eat, food		𠆢良	eat	eat		If <i>halo</i> and <i>umbrella</i> aren't enough, break the <i>halo</i> down into <i>drop</i> and <i>silver</i> - or "silverware," an additional primitive.	As a primitive, this kanji can mean either <i>eating</i> or <i>food</i>. As with <i>silver</i>, on the left the final two strokes of this element are combined into one.	食
金	gold		𠆢王丶丶	gold	gold	metal	If this were not one of the most common characters you will ever have to write, I would apologize for having to give the explanation that follows. Anyway, we want to depict bars of <b>gold</b> bullion with an <i>umbrella</i> overhead to shade them from the heat (and perhaps to hide them as well). The bullion is made by melting down all the <i>scepters</i> of the <i>king</i>dom, <i>drop</i> by <i>drop</i>, and shaping them into bars.	As a primitive, it means not only <i>gold</i> but any <i>metal</i> at all.	金
介	jammed in, shellfish, mediate, concern oneself with		𠆢丿丨	jammed in	jammed in		The idea of something getting <b>jammed in</b>to something else is depicted here by having a walking <i>stick</i> get <b>jammed in</b>to an <i>umbrella</i> frame by someone shoving it into an already occupied slot in the <i>umbrella</i> stand at the door. First notice the vertical strokes: on the left is the curved <i>umbrella</i> handle, and on the right the straight walking <i>stick</i>. Now try to imagine the two parties tugging at their respective properties like two kids on a wishbone, creating a scene at the entrance of an elegant restaurant. [4]		ハ𠆢
余	too much, myself, surplus, other, remainder		𠆢于小	too much	too much	scale	<i>Umbrella</i> . . . <i>potato</i> . . . <i>little</i>. The last stroke of <i>potato</i> and the first of <i>little</i> coincide in this character.	Since the phrase "<i>too much</i>" is overly abstract, we shall take the image of a <i>scale</i> whose indicator spins round and round on the dial because <i>too much</i> weight has been set on it. It will help to use this image in learning the kanji itself.	一二ハ𠆢亅示二小
診	checkup, seeing, diagnose, examine		言𠆢彡	checkup	checkup		<i>Words</i> . . . <i>umbrella</i> . . . <i>shape</i>. The key word refers to a medical examination.		言𠆢彡
企	undertake, scheme, design, attempt, plan		𠆢止	undertake	undertake		To <b>undertake</b> a project is to take some idea floating in the air and <i>stop</i> it so that it can be brought down to earth and become a reality. Here we see some <b>undertaking</b> made to <i>stop</i> under a beach <i>umbrella</i>.		止𠆢
珍	rare, curious, strange		王𠆢彡	rare	rare		Jewel . . . <i>umbrella</i> . . . <i>shape</i>.		王𠆢彡
幹	tree trunk, main part, talent, capability		𠦝𠆢干	tree trunk	tree trunk		<i>Mist</i> . . . <i>umbrella</i> . . . <i>dry</i>. The meaning of this key word extends beyond <b>tree trunks</b> to represent the main stem or line of anything from railway lines to managerial staffs. This should help distinguish it from the stories used earlier for <i>book</i> (Frame 224) and <i>body</i> (Frame 1030), both of which made use of the image of a <b>tree trunk</b>, as well as the kanji for <i>trunk</i> (Frame 194).		干十日𠆢
傘	umbrella		𠆢从从十	umbrella	umbrella		<b>Umbrella</b> . . . two <i>assembly line</i>s . . . <i>needle</i>.		十人𠆢
膝	knee, lap		肉木𠆢米	knee	knee		<i>Flesh</i> . . . <i>tree</i> . . . <i>umbrella</i> . . . <i>rice grains</i>.		月水木𠆢
脊	stature, height		人𠆢二二肉	spinal column	spinal column		The <b>spinal column</b> has sprouted out of the <i>flesh</i> of your back into an <i>umbrella</i> that you always have with you, rain or shine. The pair of 2s on each side are the "ribs" of the <i>umbrella</i>. Take care to keep your image of the key word distinct from that for spine (Frame 24).	Editors note: It seems the first element here is in fact <i>person 人<i/> instead of <i>umbrella 𠆢<i/> but keeping both references.	月𠆢癶二

# 人 person is not an umbrella 𠆢 !
人	person	亻	人	person	person	human	The character for <i>enter</i> (Frame 842) showed someone walking inwards (in terms of the direction of writing), the one for <b>person</b>, shown here, represents someone walking outwards.	As a primitive, it can keep its kanji form except when it appears to the left (its normal position), where it is made to stand up in the form ⺅ (Similar to イ). The primitive meaning is another matter. The abstract notion of <i>person</i> so often has a relation to the meaning of the kanji that confusion readily sets in. So many of the previous stories have included people in them that simply to use <i>person</i> for a primitive meaning would be risky. We need to be more specific, to focus on one particular <i>person</i>. Try to choose someone who has not figured in the stories so far, perhaps a colorful member of the family or a friend whom you have known for a long time. That individual will appear again and again, so be sure to choose someone who excites your imagination.	人


###########  弗 dollar sign
弗	dollar	[dollar_sign-below]	丨丨弓			dollar sign	Composed of two walking <i>stick</i>s running through a <i>bow</i>, this character is infrequent as a primitive, and yet easy to remember for what it looks like (which is also what the Japanese adopted it to mean in days gone by): the <b>dollar sign</b>, $. When it is written under another element, the first vertical stroke is abbreviated to a short "tail" as the final stroke, and the second vertical stroke is cut off at the top. Examples follow in FRAMEs 1239 and 1240. [5]		
第	No., residence		竹弗	No.	No.		The key word <b>No.</b> is the abbreviation for "number." Its elements: <i>bamboo</i> . . . <i>dollar sign</i>.		弓竹
弟	younger brother, faithful service to elders		丷弗	younger brother	younger brother		Horns . . . <i>dollar sign</i>.		｜ノ弓并
沸	seethe, boil, ferment, uproar, breed		水弗	seethe	seethe		<i>Water</i> ... <i>dollar sign</i>. [8]		｜ノ弓氵


###########  [purse] purse
[purse]						purse	By adding a single stroke at the bottom of the kanji for in, we get a sort of pictograph of a <b>purse</b>. [5]		中一
貴	precious, value, prize, esteem, honor		[purse]貝	precious	precious		<i>purse</i>.. shells.. 		｜一貝目ハ口
遣	dispatch, despatch, send, give, donate, do, undertake		[purse]㠯辶	dispatch	dispatch		This kanji takes a<i>way</i> the <i>maestro</i>'s baton and replaces it with a <i>purse</i>. The <i>road</i> represents his being <b>dispatched</b> on his <i>way</i> a san obvious misfit. You will remember that when he did have his baton, he was being <i>chased</i> down the <i>road</i> by his fans. All of which shows what a difference a single stroke can make!		｜一口辶

###########  [mending] mending
[mending]						mending	This primitive differs from the kanji for <i>correct</i> only by the movement added to the last two strokes, the “-ing” of <b>mending</b> if you will. But take a more concrete sense, like <b>mending</b> holes in socks. [5]		
足	leg, foot, be sufficient, counter for pairs of footwear	⻊	足	leg	leg	wooden leg	<i>Mouth</i> . . . <i>mending</i>. Note that the last stroke of <i>mouth</i> and the first of <i>mending</i> overlap.	As a primitive on the left, it is amended to something similar to <i>correct</i> in place of <i>mending</i>. Its meaning remains <i>leg</i>, but should be thought of as a <i>wooden leg</i> in order to avoid confusion with other similar elements, namely <i>human legs</i>, <i>animal legs</i>, and <i>walking legs</i>.	口足
定	determine, fix, establish, decide		宀[mending]	determine	determine		<b>Determination</b>, in the sense of settling on a certain course of action, is likened here to <i>mending</i> one’s <i>house</i>. [8]		疋宀
従	accompany, obey, submit to, comply, follow, secondary, incidental, subordinate		彳丷[mending]	accompany	accompany		<i>Column</i> . . . <i>animal horns</i> . . . <i>mending</i>.		并疋彳
是	just so, this, right, justice		日[mending]	just so	just so		In this kanji we are shown someone spending an entire <i>day</i> at <i>mending</i> one stocking, because they want the job done "<b>just so</b>." Be sure to make a clear image of a finicky old fusspot to make the abstract idea as concrete as possible.		日疋

########### correction for 'zoo' and related
疋	head, counter for animals			critters	critters	cloth, zoo	Rather than use this for animals in general, we will refer to it as a <b>zoo</b>, to avoid confusion with the other animals that will be showing up. Except for the downward hook at the end of the first stroke, this element is indistinguishable from <i>mending</i>. Perhaps by now you have developed a quick eye for such details. If not now, you will before long. [5]		疋
楚	whip, cane		疋木						疋木
礎	cornerstone, foundation stone		石楚林疋	cornerstone	cornerstone		This character depicts a <b>cornerstone</b> as a <i>stone</i> set at the end of a wildlife preserve (the <i>“zoo</i> in the <i>grove</i>”). [18] 		口石疋木

###########  [staple_gun] staplegun
[staple_gun]						staple gun	The familiar primitive for staples with an additional stroke cutting through the vertical stroke. It is easiest in these cases to make a primitive related to what we already know. Hence, we call it a <b>staple gun</b>.		
段	grade, steps, stairs		[staple_gun]殳	grade	grade		The kanji connoting rank or class shows us a new element on the left: the familiar primitive for <i>staples</i> with an additional stroke cutting through the vertical stroke. It is easiest in these cases to make a primitive related to what we already know. Hence, we call it a <i>staple gun</i>. To the right, <i>missile</i>.		｜殳几又

########### 乍 saw
# correction: it's NOT 'staple gun' but a 'saw'
乍	though, notwithstanding, while, during, both, all					saw	The <b>saw</b> in this primitive is distinguished from the primitive for ax by the extra “teeth” on the blade. [5]		｜ノ一

###########  冊 scrapbook
論	argument, discourse		言侖亼冊	argument	argument		<i>Words</i> ... <i>meeting</i> ... <i>scrapbook</i>. The <b>argument</b> here is a process of academic reasoning, not a personal quarrel or spat. [15]		｜一言𠆢冊
輪	wheel, ring, circle, link, loop, counter for wheels and flowers		車侖亼冊	wheel	wheel		<i>Car</i> . . . <i>meeting</i> . . . <i>scrapbook</i>.		｜一車𠆢冊
倫	ethics, companion		人侖亼冊	ethics	ethics		<i>Person</i> . . . <i>meeting</i> . . . <i>scrapbook</i>.		｜一⺅𠆢亅冊
偏	partial, side, left-side radical, inclining, biased		人戸冊	partial	partial		<i>Person</i> . . . <i>door</i> . . . <i>scrapbook</i>. The sense of the key-word is that of having a bias or preference for someone or something.		｜一⺅戸冂冊尸
侖	think, be methodical		亼冊					Editors' note: Non-Heisig keyword	𠆢冂廾冊


###########  [tail_feathers] tail feathers
[tail_feathers]						tail feathers	So as not to confuse this primitive element with the character for feathers, think of the extravagant tail-feather plumage of the peacock. The form itself is too pictographic to need breaking down further. [5]		
馬	horse		長[tail_feathers]	horse	horse		Let the extra vertical stroke in the <i>mane</i> combine with the first vertical stroke to give an image of the <b>horse's</b> <i>long</i> neck. The only odd thing is the <i>tail feathers</i> at the end, but that should present a good image to remember the character by. The fact that the last stroke of <i>mane</i> and the first of <i>tail feathers</i> coincide should no <i>long</i>er surprise you.	As a primitive, this kanji will mean a <i>team of horses</i> as distinct from the single <i>horse</i> whose primitive we met earlier.	馬
鳥	bird, chicken		白一[tail_feathers]	bird	bird		<i>Dove</i> . . . <i>one</i> . . . <i>tail feathers</i>. This is, of course, the character from which we derived the primitive meaning of <i>dove</i>. Note the lengthening of the second stroke.		鳥灬
為	do, change, make, benefit, welfare, be of use, reach to, try, practice, cost, serve as, good, advantage, as a result of		丶[tail_feathers]	do	do		This character rightly belongs to the previous lesson, but we held it until now because of the final element, the <i>tail feathers</i>. After the <i>drop</i> at the outset, the next three strokes are completely novel and should be given special attention. [9]		ノ灬
薦	recommend, mat, advise, encourage, offer		艹鹿一[tail_feathers]	recommend	recommend		<i>Flowers</i> . . . <i>deer</i> . . . <i>one</i> . . . <i>tail feathers</i>. Note the doubling up in these last two elements as in frame 2091.		广灬⺾

########### ⺍ owl primitive
⺍						owl	We have already met these three strokes before. When they come under another stroke, they represent a claw, and thence a vulture. And when placed atop a roof structure, they create a schoolhouse. The <b>owl</b> has something to do with both: it is a bird of prey, and it has come to be associated in the popular imagination with learning. [3]		
巣	nest, rookery, hive, cobweb, den		⺍果	nest	nest		<i>owl</i>.. <i>fruit</i>.. 		⺌田木

# 小 is NOT 'owl ⺍' !!!  Add also primitive alternative ⺌
小	little, small	⺌	小	little	little		The sense of <b>little</b> that this character represents is not the same as "a <b>little</b> bit." That meaning comes in the next frame. Here <b>little</b> means "small" or "tiny." The image is one of three <b>little</b> <i>drops</i>, the first of which (the one in the middle) is written larger so that the kanji has some shape to it. The point of writing it three times is to rub the point in: <b>little</b>, <b>little</b>, nothing but <b>little</b>.	The primitive of the same shape keeps the same meaning. Written above a horizontal line, its form is slightly altered, the last two strokes turning inwards like this ⺌.	小

###########  [schoolhouse] schoolhouse
[schoolhouse]			⺍冖			schoolhouse	Here we see a little red <b>schoolhouse</b> with the 3 dots on the roof. As you write it in the following FRAMEs, you should acquire a "feel" for the way the first two short strokes move left to right, and the the third one right to left. Write it twice now, saying to yourself the first time as you write the first 3 strokes, "In the <b>schoolhouse</b> we learn our A-B-Cs," and the second time, "In the <b>schoolhouse</b> we learn our 1-2-fis." [5]		
学	study, learning, science		[schoolhouse]子	study	study		<i>schoolhouse</i> 		子⺌冖
覚	memorize, learn, remember, awake, sober up		[schoolhouse]見	memorize	memorize		The idea of <b>memorizing</b> things is easily related to the <i>schoolhouse</i>; and since we have been at it for more than a hundred pages in this book, the idea that <b>memorizing</b> involves <i>seeing</i> things that are not really there should make it easy to put the two elements together.		見⺌冖
栄	flourish, prosperity, honor, glory, splendor		[schoolhouse]木	flourish	flourish		The botanical connotations of the word <b>flourish</b> (to bud and burst into bloom, much as a <i>tree</i> does) are part of the ideal of the <i>schoolhouse</i> as well.		⺌木冖

###########  [apron] apron
[apron]			冖巾			apron	The <i>towel</i> with edges jagged like little <i>crowns</i> is the cook’s <b>apron</b>. [5]		
帰	homecoming, arrive at, lead to, result in		[spear]帚ヨ[apron]	homecoming	homecoming		<i>Spear</i> . . . <i>broom</i> . . . <i>apron</i>. The character for <i>lady</i> (Frame 1234) shares the same right side as this character, which does not bode for a very happy <b>homecoming</b>.		ヨ刂巾冖
帯	sash, belt, obi, zone, region		丗[apron]	sash	sash		The part of the <i>apron</i> where one finds the <i>buckle</i> (represented pictorially by thefirst 5 strokes) is on the <b>sash</b>. [10] 		｜一巾冖
婦	lady, woman, wife, bride		女ヨ[apron]	lady	lady		<i>Woman</i> . . . <i>broom</i> . . . <i>apron</i>.		ヨ巾女冖
帝	sovereign, the emperor, god, creator		立[apron]	sovereign	sovereign		An uncommon, but not altogether unlikely picture of a reigning <b>sovereign</b> has him <i>standing up</i> in his <i>apron</i>, presumably at the behest of HIS <b>sovereign</b> (she who is to be obeyed), who needs help with washing the dishes.		巾并立亠冖
掃	sweep, brush		扌ヨ[apron]	sweep	sweep		<i>Fingers</i> . . . <i>broom</i> . . . <i>apron</i>.		ヨ巾冖扌

########### 高 tall
# Add [tall] primitive alternative
高	tall, high, expensive	[tall]	亠口冂口	tall	tall		Recalling an image from frame 195, first see the <i>mouth</i> under the extraterrestrial's glass <i>hood</i>, and then the <i>mouth</i> under the <i>top hat</i> of one of his mates who has tried on the strange earthling's headgear only to find that it makes him look much, much <b>taller</b> than everyone else.	As a primitive, this character keeps its sense of <i>tall</i> and its position at the top of other primitives, but its writing is abbreviated to the first 5 strokes.	口高亠冂
京	capital, 10**16		亠口高小	capital	capital		When we think of a <b>capital</b> city today we think of <i>tall</i> skyscrapers dwarfing the endless swarms of <i>little</i> folk scurrying here and there about their business.		口小亠
亭	pavilion, restaurant, mansion, arbor, cottage, vaudeville, music hall, stage name		亠口冖丁高	pavilion	pavilion		Think of all the <b>pavilions</b> at County Fairs or World Expos you have wandered into or seen advertised in the media, and you will no doubt see rising up among them the towering <i>tall crowned nail</i> (the <i>crown</i> being a revolving restaurant) - that architectural monstrosity that has become a symbol of science and technology at such events.		口亅亠冖
享	enjoy, receive, undergo, answer (phone), take, get, catch		亠口高子	receive	receive	tall children	<i>Tall children</i> <b>receive</b> more attention. <i>Tall children</i> grow up to make better wide <b>receivers</b>. Take your pick, depending on whether you prefer <i>child</i> psychology or American football. At any rate, be sure you have some particular <i>tall child</i> in mind, someone who really was outstanding and always attracting attention, because he or she will come in handy in the next two frames.		口子亠
豪	overpowering, great, powerful, excelling, Australia		亠口高冖豕	overpowering	overpowering		<i>Tall</i> . . . crowned . . . <i>sow</i>.		口亠冖豕
塾	cram school, private school		享丸土	cram school	cram school		<b>Cram schools</b> are after-hours educational institutions where kids can do concentrated preparing for their coming entrance examinations or drill what they missed during regular class hours. The exception are the <i>tall children</i> who are out on the school <i>grounds</i> practicing sports, and the <i>fat</i> ones who are out there burning off calories. So this character depicts those who do NOT go to the <b>cram schools</b>, rather than those who do.		丶九口子土亠

######### 喬 angel primitive
喬	high, boasting		口冂	heaven-high		angels	The sense of the primitive, angel, derives from the primitive for witch replacing the top hat in the character for [tall] tall. [12]		ノ口冂大
橋	bridge		木喬	bridge	bridge		The <b>bridge</b> shown here is made of <i>tree</i>s in their natural form, except that the trunks have been carved into the forms of <i>angels</i>, a sort of “Ponte degli Angeli.” [16]		ノ口木冂

###########  [piglets] piglets
[piglets]						piglets	This abbreviation of the full primitive for a sow, quite naturally, means <b>piglets</b>. [5]		
腸	intestines, guts, bowels, viscera		肉昜	intestines	intestines		<i>Flesh</i>.. piggybank.. 		一月日勿
昜	open, sun		日[piglets]			piggy bank	This very helpful primitive element is worth the few moments it takes to learn it. Just remember that each <i>day</i> you put a few pennies into the back of the little piglet on your bureau that you call a <b>piggy bank</b>. 		ノ一日勿

###########  [celery] celery
[celery]			一龷			celery	This primitive looks very close to that for <i>salad</i>, except that an extra horizontal line has been included, reminiscent I should think of the long <b>celery</b> sticks in your <i>salad</i>. [5]		
寒	cold		宀[celery]ハ冫	cold	cold		<i>House</i> . . . <i>celery</i> . . . <i>animal legs</i> . . . ice. [12] 		一ハ宀丶井
塞	close, shut, cover, block, obstruct		宀[celery]ハ土	block up	block up		<i>House</i> . . . <i>celery</i> . . . <i>animal legs</i> . . . <i>soil</i>.		一土ハ宀

###### 㐮 grass skirt 
# grass skirt 㐮 is not 襄
㐮	grass skirt		衣ハ[celery]	grass skirt	grass skirt		This unusual looking <b>grass skirt</b> is composed of a <i>top hat and scarf</i>, and eight <i>celery</i> sticks. [13]		衣ハ亠
醸	brew, cause		酉㐮	brew	brew		<i>Whiskey bottle</i> ... <i>grass skirt</i>. [20]		衣酉ハ亠

譲	defer, turnover, transfer, convey		言㐮	defer	defer		<i>Words</i> . . . <i>grass skirt</i>.		衣言ハ亠
壌	lot, earth, soil		土㐮	lot	lot		<i>Ground</i> . . . <i>grass skirt</i>. The <b>lot</b> of this key word refers to a portion of <i>land</i>.		衣土ハ亠

########### 衣 garment
衣	garment, clothes, dressing	[top_hat_and_scarf]𧘇	亠𧘇	garment	garment		At the top we see the <i>top hat</i>, and at the bottom a pictographic representation of the folds of a <b>garment</b>. If you break the "4-fold" fold into 2 sets of 2 strokes, you will find it easier to remember.	Used as a primitive, the additional meanings of <i>cloak</i> or <i>scarf</i> will come in handy. What has to be noted particularly are the changes in shape the kanji can undergo when it becomes an element in other kanji. In fact, it is the most volatile of all the kanji we shall treat, and for that reason deserves special attention here. When it appears to the left, it looks like a hiragana ne (ネ) with an extra drop on the right, and we shall take it to mean <i>cloak</i>. At the bottom, when attached to the stroke immediately above it, the first two strokes (the <i>top hat</i>) are omitted, which we shall take to mean a <i>scarf</i>. On rare occasions, the element can be torn right across the middle, with the first 2 strokes appearing at the top and the last 4 at the bottom of another primitive or cluster of primitive, in which cases we shall speak of a <i>top hat and scarf</i>. And finally, of course, it can keep its original kanji shape, along with its original meaning of <i>garment</i> in general. Note that when any of the above forms have something beneath them (as in frame 429), the third from final stroke is "unhooked."	衣亠
裏	back, amidst, in, reverse, inside, palm, sole, rear, lining, wrongside		衣里	back	back		An innocent looking <i>top hat and scarf</i> lying there in front of you, turned over, reveal a hidden <i>computer</i> sewn into the <b>back</b> of each - obviously the tools of a master spy. Such expe<i>ri</i>ences teach one always to have a look at the <b>back</b> side of things.		['衣里亠']
環	ring, circle, link, wheel		王罒一口衣	ring	ring		<i>Jewel</i> . . . <i>eye</i> . . . <i>ceiling</i> . . . <i>mouth</i> . . . <i>scarf</i>. The number of elements is large here, so take extra care. Learn it in conjunction with the next frame, since these are the only two cases in this book where the combination of elements to the right appears.		衣王口罒一
褒	praise, extol		衣保	praise	praise		<i>Top hat and scarf</i> . . . <i>protect</i>. Note that the "tree" in <i>protect</i> becomes a <i>wooden pole</i> here.		['衣⺅口小亠']
哀	pathetic, grief, sorrow, pathos, pity, sympathize		衣口	pathetic	pathetic		A drunken sod in a tattered <i>top hat</i> and soiled silk <i>scarf</i> with a giant <i>mouth</i> guzzling something or other gives us a <b>pathetic</b> character role in which W. C. Fields might find himself right at home.		['衣口亠']
還	send back, return		罒一口衣辶	send back	send back		<i>Road</i> . . . <i>eye</i> . . . <i>ceiling</i> . . . <i>mouth</i> . . . scarf.		衣口辶罒一
衰	decline, wane, weaken		衣口一	decline	decline		Let this key word connote the <b>decline</b> and fall of the Roman Empire. It shows a fellow in a <i>top hat</i> and <i>scarf</i>, trying hard to look happy by putting a <i>walking stick</i> in his <i>mouth</i> sideways to twist his face into a grotesque but semi permanent smile.		['衣一亠']
衷	inmost, heart, mind, inside		衣口丨	inmost	inmost		Between the <i>top hat</i> and the <i>scarf</i> you will see the character for <i>in</i> which is truncated at the bottom so as not to interfere with the <i>scarf</i>. You can think of this character forming as a pair with that of the former frame: there the <i>in</i> (the <i>walking stick</i> in the <i>mouth</i>) was set on its side; here it is set upright.		['衣十口']

###########  [lidded_crock] lidded crock
[lidded_crock]			土囗			lidded crock	oil over the mouth of a container gives us a piece of clay pottery with its lid. Behold the <b>lidded crock</b>. [6]		土囗
遠	distant, far		袁[lidded_crock]衣辶	distant	distant		A <b>distant</b> figure on the <i>road</i> is such a blur it looks like a <i>lidded crock</i> wearing a silk <i>scarf</i>.		衣口辶土
園	park, garden, yard, farm		囗[lidded_crock]衣袁	park	park		<i>Pent in</i> . . . <i>lidded crock</i> . . . scarf.		衣口土囗
周	circumference, circuit, lap		冂[lidded_crock]	circumference	circumference		Look more closely at your <i>lidded crock</i> and you will see little ruler marks along its bottom edge. This is so you can use it to calculate the <b>circumference</b> of your <i>motorcycle helmet</i>: just begin at a fixed point and turn the <i>lidded crock</i> around and around, keeping it flush against the side of the <i>helmet</i>, until you come back to your starting point. If you kept track of how many turns and part-turns your <i>lidded crock</i> made, you now know the <b>circumference</b>.	As a primitive, this character can take the added significance of a <i>lap</i>.	口土冂
舎	cottage, inn, hut, house, mansion		𠆢[lidded_crock]	cottage	cottage		A <i>lidded crock</i> with an <i>umbrella</i> overhead gives us a mixture of the modern and the nostalgic in this design for a <b>cottage</b>. [8]		口土𠆢
猿	monkey		犬[lidded_crock]衣袁	monkey	monkey		This clever little <b>monkey</b> has captured an entire pack of <i>wild dogs</i>, locked them inside a <i>lidded crock</i>, and wrapped the whole thing up in a silk <i>scarf</i> to present to the <i>dog</i>catcher.		衣口土犭
袁	long kimono		[lidded_crock]衣						衣口土

# remove 'lidded crock' primitive keyword (that's soil+mouth, this is samurai+mouth) !
吉	good luck, joy, congratulations		士口	good luck	good luck	aerosol can	Here we see a <i>samurai</i> standing on a street with an open <i>mouth</i>, which people walk up to and look down deep inside of for <b>good luck</b>.	As a primitive, we shall take this shape to mean an <i>aerosol can</i>, from the <i>mouth</i> and the very tightly-fitting <i>lid</i> (note how it differs here from the <i>lidded crock</i>).	口士

####### 𠫓 infant primitive
𠫓						infant	This primitive can be seen as an abbreviation of the full primitive for child, the second stroke dividing the head from the body much as it does in { and the other strokes condensing the long form so that it can be used atop its relative primitive. We change the meaning to <b>infant</b> to facilitate keeping the full form and its abbreviation distinct. [4]		亠厶
棄	abandon, throw away, discard, resign, reject, sacrifice		𠫓丗木	abandon	abandon		<i>infant</i>.. <i>buckle</i>.. <i>tree</i>.. 		一木亠凵厶

###########  [mama-top] mama(top)
母	mother	毋[mama-top]	母	mama	mama	breasts	Look closely at this kanji and you will find the outline of the kanji for <i>woman</i> in it, the second stroke of which has been expanded to make space for the two <b>breasts</b> that make her a <b>mama</b>. Likening this sound to a baby nursing at its mother's breast has afforded some scholars of comparative linguistics a way to explain the presence of the same word across a wide range of language groups.	As a primitive we shall add the meaning of <i>breasts</i> in accord with the explanation given above. Take careful note of the fact that the form is altered slightly when this kanji serves as a primitive, the final two dots joining together to form a longer stroke. An example follows in the next frame.	母毋

###########  龷 salad
# Add salad because it is a distinct entity from flowers
龷			艹一			salad	The element for <i>flowers</i> joins with the long horizontal stroke beneath it to create the picture of a bowl of <b>salad</b>. [4]

###########  [staples] staples
[staples]						staples	This primitive represents a number of small <b>staples</b>, like the kind commonly used in an office and at school. [4]		
印	stamp, seal, mark, imprint, symbol, emblem, trademark, evidence, souvenir, India		[staples]卩	stamp	stamp		At last we come to the general character meaning <i>stamp</i>. Its elements: <i>staples</i> . . . <b>stamp</b>. [6]		｜卩
暇	spare time, rest, leisure, time, leave of absence		日叚[staples]口又	spare time	spare time		The element for <i>day</i> on the left is logical enough. Next to it we see <i>staples</i> being held in <i>mouth</i> (one stroke is doubled up), indicating working in one's hobby or handicrafts at home on one's <b>spare time</b>. The small <i>box</i> at the top right is facing backwards, or more properly "inside out." Finally, we have the <i>crotch</i> at the bottom.		日又
臼	mortar		[staples]	mortar	mortar		The image here is of <i>back-to-back staples</i>. The <b>mortar</b> referred to in this key word is a stone or wooden basin used for grinding with a pestle.		臼

###########  ⺁ drag
⺁	drag	[drag-bottom]	⺁		drag		Although not a pictograph in the strict sense, this primitive depicts one stroke pulling another along behind it. Note how it differs from cliff and person because of this <i>drag</i>ging effect,not to mention the fact that the first stroke is written right to left, almost as if it were a long drop. When this element comes under a different element, the strokes are drawn apart like this: [<b>drag</b>-bottom] [2]		
后	empress, queen, after, behind, back, later		⺁一口	empress	empress		<i>Drag</i> . . . <i>one</i> . . . <i>mouth</i>.		ノ一斤口亅厂

###########  [rag] rag primitive
[rag]						rag	Let the last 4 strokes, which are also the concluding strokes to the character for garment, represent a <b>rag</b> as its primitive meaning		
表	surface, table, chart, diagram		龶[rag]	surface	surface		<i>Grow up</i> . . . <i>rags</i>. This character represents the "outside" of a garment, just as the kanji for <i>back</i> (Frame 426) depicted the "inside" or lining.		衣士
旅	trip, travel		[banner][rag]	trip	trip		Let the last 4 strokes, which are also the concluding strokes to the character for <i>garment</i>, represent a <i>rag</i> as its primitive meaning. We shall meet this only on one other occasion. This gives us as our elements: <i>banner</i> . . . <i>rag</i>.		['ノ方一']
派	faction, group, party, clique, sect, school		水𠂢[rag]⺁	faction	faction		<i>Water</i> . . . <i>drag</i> . . . <i>rag</i>. Back in frame 1127 we indicated that this latter radical would come up once again, as it does in this and the following two frames.		斤氵厂

###########  [hairpin] hairpin primitive
[hairpin]						hairpin	Here we have a quasi-pictograph of the colorful and decorated clips used to bind up long hair. Note its similarity to the scarf, which differs only by the addition of one stroke. [4]		
展	unfold, expand		尸龷[hairpin]	unfold	unfold		<i>Flag</i> . . . <i>salad</i> . . . <i>hairpin</i>.		｜衣一二尸

########### 長 long
# Add [mane] and [hair]  primitive alternatives
長	long, leader, superior, senior	[mane][hair]	[hairpin]	long	long		In line with the story of the preceding frame, the hair that needs the <i>hairpin</i> is <b>long</b>. [8]	The primitive of this kanji has two more shapes in addition to that of the kanji itself. Above its relative primitive, it is abbreviated form will mean <i>hair [hair]</i>. Further abbreviated,  it will mean the <b>long</b>, mangy <i>mane [mane]</i> of an animal.	長

########### 耒 christmas tree
耒	come, plough, three-branch tree radical (no. 127)		丰木			christmas tree	The addition of the final two strokes to the element for <i>bushes</i> gives the sense of a <i>tree</i> that is also a bush. Hence, the <b>Christmas tree</b>. [6]		｜木耒ノノ
籍	enroll, domiciliary register, membership		竹耒昔	enroll	enroll		<i>Bamboo</i> . . . <i>Christmas tree</i> . . . <i>once upon a time</i>.		｜一竹土日ハ木亠耒

########### 丰 bushes [bushes-side]
丰	abundant, lush, bountiful, plenty, fat face, luxurious growth of grass	[bushes-side]				bushes	Whatever image you contrived for the character meaning hedge (FRAME 154 垣), choose something different and clearly distinguishable for this primitive for <b>bushes</b>. The element itself differs from that for grow up only in the extension of the single vertical stroke beneath the final horizontal stroke and in the order of writing. Though we shall meet only one instance of it in this chapter and one more later on, it is worth noting that when this element appears on the side, the final stroke is sloped somewhat to the left: [<b>bushes</b>-side]. [4]		一｜二

########### 𡗗 bonsai
𡗗			丰			bonsai	The element for <i>bushes</i> has an extra stroke added (drawn from the point where the second and fifth strokes intersect when it "encloses" something beneath, otherwise from the point where the fourth and fifth strokes intersect) to give the image of the crutches Japanese gardeners use to hold up a tree that is being bent into shape. From there it is but a short leap to the small <b>bonsai</b> plants that imitate this art in miniature. [5]		一二人
春	springtime, spring (season)		𡗗日	springtime	springtime		<i>Bonsai</i> ... <i>sun</i>. [9]		一二日人


###########  [cornstalk] cornstalk
[cornstalk]						cornstalk	The element for bushes 丰 extended the vertical stroke beneath the final horizontal stroke; the <b>cornstalk</b> omits that final stroke altogether, leaving only the stalk and the leaves bursting forth on all sides. [3]		
奉	observance, offer, present, dedicate		𡗗[cornstalk]	dedicate	dedicate		<i>Bonsai</i> . . . <i>cornstalk</i>. Use a ritualistic, religious meaning. [8] 		｜一人大二

########### 丂 snare
丂	obstruction of breath (qi) as it seeks release, variant of other characters					snare, slingshot	The simple <b>snare</b> composed of a piece of vine and a bent twig is depicted here as a sort of abbreviation of the bow, to which it is related. [2]		一勹

###########  [sparkler] sparkler
[sparkler]						sparkler	As the pictograph itself immediately suggests, this element depicts spreading out or scattering from a focal point. To capture this meaning, we choose the image of a <b>sparkler</b>. It will often have another primitive put at its center point. [4]		
楽	music, comfort, ease		白[sparkler]木	music	music		Dove . . . <i>sparkler</i> . . . <i>tree</i>.		白木冫
率	ratio, rate, proportion, %, factor, lead, spearhead, command		玄[sparkler]十	ratio	ratio		<i>Mysterious</i> . . . <i>sparkler</i> . . . <i>ten</i>. Do not confuse with <i>proportion</i> (Frame 1673).		玄十亠冫幺

塁	bases, fort, rampart, walls, base(ball)		田[sparkler]土	bases	bases		The kanji of this frame refers to the four <b>bases</b> that are placed at the corners of a baseball field. The elements: field . . . <i>sparkler</i> . . . ground. [12]		田土冫
函	box (archaic)		丂[sparkler]凵	bin	bin		This is the character from which the element for <i>shovel</i> derives. Within it comes the element for <i>snare</i>, with the <i>sparkler</i> surrounding it.		一水凵

########### 弋 arrow 
弋	piling, ceremony radical (no. 56)					arrow	Here we see a pictograph of a long and slightly warped <b>arrow</b>. By extending the short final stroke in both directions, you should see the <b>arrow</b>head without any difficulty. The hook at the bottom represents the feathers at the butt end. When it serves as a semienclosure for other primitives, the first stroke is drawn longer, as we shall see in the following FRAMEs. [3]		弋

###########  [clothes_hanger] clotheshanger
ヿ						enclosure, clothes hanger	This element, which looks something like a backwards hook, we will call a <b>clothes hanger</b>. Used as an <b>enclosure</b>, it begins further to the left. [1]		
幻	phantasm, vision, dream, illusion, apparition		幺ヿ	phantasm	phantasm		<i>Cocoon</i> . . . <i>clothes hanger</i>. [4] 		幺


###########  [plow] plow
[plow]						plow	Take this as a pictograph of a <b>plow</b>. [2]		
以	by means of, because, in view of, compared with		人[plow]丶	by means of	by means of		Picture a <i>person</i> dragging a <i>plow</i> behind, and the <i>drop of</i> sweat which falls from his brow as he does his work.

瓦	tile, gram		一[plow]乙丶	tile	tile		<i>Ceiling</i> . . . <i>plow</i> . . . <i>fishhook</i> . . . a <i>drop</i> of.		瓦一


########### 乙 hook / fishhook
# add primitive alternatives and primitive keyword
乙	the latter, duplicate, strange, witty, fishhook radical (no. 5)	乚L	乙	fish guts	fish guts	fishhook	The kanji shown here actually represents the "second" position in the old Chinese zodiac, which the Japanese still use as an alternate way of enumeration, much the same way that English will revert to Roman numerals. Among its many other meanings are "pure," "tasteful," "quaint," and - get this! - <b>fish guts</b>. Since it is a pictograph of a <b>fishhook</b>, it should not be hard to associate it with the key word.	We will keep <i>fishhook</i> as the primitive meaning. Its shape will rarely be quite the same as that of the kanji. When it appears at the bottom of another primitive, it is straightened out, almost as if the weight of the upper element had bent it out of shape. And when it appears to the right of another element, the short horizontal line that gets the shape started is omitted and it is stretched out and narrowed, all for reasons of space and aesthetics. Examples follow.	乙
也	to be (classical)		乙	est	est	scorpion	This primitive is a pictograph of the <b>scorpion</b>, the first 2 strokes representing its head and pincers, the last stroke its barbed tail, in which you may recognize the <i>fishhook</i>. [3]		｜乙匕也
気	spirit, mind, air, atmosphere, mood		气乂	spirit	spirit		The <b>spirit</b> in this character refers to the changeable moods and airs of one's personality as well as to the more essential combination of vital forces that distinguish things and individuals one from the other. Its elements are: <i>reclining</i> . . . <i>floor</i> . . . <i>fishhook</i> . . . <i>sheaf</i>. Do not confuse with <i>spirits</i> (Frame 1930).		气丶ノ
直	straightaway, honesty, frankness, fix, repair		十目乙	straightaway	straightaway		Begin with the top two primitives, <i>needle</i> and <i>eye</i>. Together they represent the <i>eye of a needle</i>. Below them is a <i>fishhook</i> that has been <b>straightened out</b> and its barb removed so that it can pass through the <i>eye of the needle</i>.		十目｜一
飛	fly, skip (pages), scatter		乙升丶	fly	fly		The two <i>large hooks</i> have little propellers (the two <i>drops</i> on each <i>hook</i>) attached to them for <b>flying</b>. Beneath is the <i>measuring box</i>, which serves as the body of this <b>flying</b> contraption. The stroke order will cause some problems, so take care with it.		飛
断	severance, decline, refuse, apologize, warn, dismiss, prohibit, decision, judgement, cutting		米乙斤	severance	severance		<i>Fishhook</i> . . . <i>rice</i> . . . <i>ax</i>.		斤米｜一
式	style, ceremony, rite, function, method, system, form, expression		弋工	style	style		Take <b>style</b> in its sense of some fashion design or model. Then let the element <i>arrow</i> and <i>craft</i> stand for the well-known <b>style</b> of shirts known as “<i>Arrow</i> shirts” because of the little <i>arrow</i> sewn on each one. [6]		工弋
亡	deceased, the late, dying, perish		亠乙	deceased	deceased		A <i>top hat</i> hanging on a <i>hook</i> in the front hall, right where the <b>deceased</b> left it the day he died, reminds us of him and his kanji.	In addition to <i>deceased</i>, the primitive meaning of <i>to perish</i> will also be used for this character.	亡亠
氏	family name, surname, clan		一乙	family name	family name		Pay close attention to the stroke order of the elements when learning to write this character. The elements: a long <i>drop</i> . . . <i>fishhook</i> . . . a <i>one</i> . . . <i>fishhook</i>.		氏
継	inherit, succeed, continue, patch, graft (tree)		糸米乙	inherit	inherit		<i>Thread</i> . . . <i>rice</i> . . . <i>fishhook</i>. Compare frame 1218.		｜糸幺小米
純	genuine, purity, innocence, net (profit)		糸屯	genuine	genuine		<i>Thread</i> . . . <i>earthworm</i>. [10] 		糸幺小屯
札	tag, paper money, counter for bonds, placard, bid		木乙	tag	tag		The <b>tags</b> you see hanging on <i>trees</i> in public places in Japan are helpful to identify what sort of <i>trees</i> they are. Next time you see one, imagine the bit of wire that fixes the <b>tag</b> to the branch as a large <i>fishhook</i>. REALLY imagine it, illogical as it is, and you will never have trouble with this kanji again.		乙木
県	prefecture		目乙小	prefecture	prefecture		Above, an <i>eye</i> and a <i>fishhook</i>, and below the primitive for <i>little</i>. Although apparently the simplest of these first six kanji, when you begin to work on its plot and story you will soon find out that the number of strokes and visual complexity of a kanji does not make it easier or harder to remember. It is the primitives you have to work that are the critical factor, as in this case where the meaning of the key word is so seemingly distant from the elements. Remember, you can always break larger elements down (<i>eye of a needle</i> into <i>eye</i> and <i>fishhook</i>) if you think it helps.		小目
孔	cavity, hole, slit, very, great, exceedingly		子乙	cavity	cavity		Probably the one thing most <i>children</i> fear more than anything else is the dentist's chair. Once a <i>child</i> has seen a dentist holding the x-rays up to the light and heard that ominous word <b>cavity</b>, even though it is not likely to know that the word means "hole" until it is much older, it will not be long before those two syllables get associated with the drill and that row of shiny <i>hooks</i> the dentist uses to torture people who are too small to fight back.		乙子
乞	beg, invite, ask		𠂉乙	beg	beg		See someone <i>lying down</i> in a public place with a <i>hook</i> in place of a hand, <b>begging</b> a morsel of rice or a few pence.		ノ一乙
迅	swift, fast		卂乙十辶	swift	swift		Here we see a <i>crossing</i> in the form of a barbed <i>fishhook</i>, suggesting a <b>swifter</b> alternate not only to the roundabouts used in Europe but also to the "cloverleaf" design used on superhigh<i>way</i>s in the United States.		辶十
气	spirit, steam radical (no. 84)		𠂉一乙				Its elements are: <i>reclining</i> . . . <i>floor</i> . . . <i>fishhook</i>  Do not confuse with <i>spirits</i> (Frame 1930).		气
屯	barracks, police station, camp, ton		丶凵乙	barracks	barracks	earthworm	<b>Earthworm</b> primitive: <i>Drop</i> of . . . <i>shovel</i> . . . <i>fishhook</i>. [4]		ノ乙凵屯
卂	to fly rapidly		乙十						乙十


###########  [slingshot] slingshot
[slingshot]						slingshot	The <b>slingshot</b> differs from the snare by virtue of the first stroke, which you may take as the strip of rubber you pull back on, to make the <b>slingshot</b> sling. [2]		
考	consider, think over		老[slingshot]	consider	consider	thought	<i>Old man</i> . . . <i>slingshot</i>. Remember: you already have kanji for <i>discriminating</i> (Frame 521), <i>deliberation</i> (Frame 692), and <i>think</i> (Frame 651).		⺹勹
与	bestow, participate in, give, award, impart, provide, cause, gift, godsend		一[slingshot]	bestow	bestow		<i>Slingshot</i> . . . <i>one</i>. Later we shall learn the character for give (frame 1897). But already here we can take care to distinguish this key word from impart (frame 736) and grant (frame 1052). [3]		勹一卜

########### 龍 dragon (old)
龍	dragon, imperial		立月[slingshot]己三	dragon (old)	dragon (old)		<i>vase</i> . . . <i>flesh</i> . . . <i>slingshot</i> . . . <i>fishhook</i> (enclosure) . . . <i>three</i>		月立
襲	attack, advance on, succeed to, pile, heap		龍立月[slingshot]己三衣	attack	attack		<i>Vase</i> . . . <i>meat</i> . . . <i>slingshot</i> (doubled up with) <i>snake</i> . . . <i>three</i> . . . <i>garment</i>. The top half of this character is the old form for the kanji in frame 575.		衣月立
篭	seclude oneself, cage, coop, implied		竹竜	cage	basket		<i>Bamboo</i> . . . <i>dragon</i>. Note that the older (and still official) form of this kanji uses the old character for <i>dragon</i> 龍, which is good to learn and is fun to write in any case. It is made up of five primitive elements: <i>vase</i> . . . <i>flesh</i> . . . <i>slingshot</i> . . . <i>fishhook</i> (enclosure) . . . <i>three</i>.		竹立竜


###########  [quiver] quiver
[quiver]			一弋			quiver	This primitive is easy to remember as depicting something used to bring all <i>one</i>’s <i>arrows</i> together into <i>one</i> handy place: the <b>quiver</b>. [4]		
武	warrior, military, chivalry, arms		一弋止[quiver]	warrior	warrior		With a <i>quiver</i> of <i>arrows</i> set on <i>one</i>'s back, the goal of the <b>warrior</b> depicted here is not to attack but merely to <i>stop</i> the attack of others: the oldest excuse in history!		止弋
弐	II, two, second		二[quiver]	II (two)	II (two)		We use the Roman numeral ii here to stress that this kanji is an older form of the kanji for <i>two</i>. Think of <i>two</i> arrows in a <i>quiver</i>, standing up like the numeral ii. [6]		一弋二


###########  [cabbage] cabbage
[cabbage]			艹口龶			cabbage	The flower, the <i>mouth</i>, and the element for <i>grow up</i> combine here to create the primitive for <b>cabbage</b>. [10]		
謹	discreet, reverently, humbly		言[cabbage]	discreet	discreet		<i>Words</i> . . . <i>cabbage</i>. 		言土⺾口
勤	diligence, become employed, serve		[cabbage]力	diligence	diligence		<i>Cabbage</i> . . . muscle.		土力⺾口

###########  [scarecrow] scarecrow
[scarecrow]			艹口夫			scarecrow	By twisting the final two strokes of our cabbage into a pair of legs (it's actually <i>husband</i>), we get a <b>scarecrow</b> with a cabbage for a head. [10]		
嘆	sigh, lament, moan, grieve, sigh of admiration		口[scarecrow]	sigh	sigh		<i>Mouth</i> . . . <i>scarecrow</i>.		ノ一口⺾

漢	Sino-, China		水[scarecrow]	Sino-	Sino-		<i>Water</i> ... <i>scarecrow</i>. The key word has come to refer to things Chinese in general, including the kanji themselves (for which this character is used). [13]		氵⺾口一大

# This kanji depicts neither scarecrow nor cabbage (top part is not flowers but twenty)
堇			廿口龶						
僅	a wee bit		人堇廿口龶	trifle	trifle		<i>Person</i>... <i>Twenty</i>.. <i>Mouth</i>..  <i>Grow up</i>		⺅土⺾口


###########  龶 growup
龶						grow up, master	As the plant grows up it sprouts leaves and a stalk, which are depicted here over a single horizontal stroke for the soil. Think of something (its relative primitive) growing up in a flash to many times its normal size, much like little Alice in Wonderland, who grew up so fast she was soon larger than the room in which she was sitting. [4]		
生	life, genuine, birth		丶龶	life	life	cell	A single <i>drop</i> added to the element for <i>grow up</i> gives us the character for <b>life</b>.	As a primitive, we may think of a microscopic cell, that miraculous unit that grows up to become a living being.	生
潔	undefiled, pure, clean, righteous, gallant		水龶刀糸	undefiled	undefiled		<i>Water</i> . . . <i>grow up</i> . . . <i>dagger</i> . . . <i>thread</i>. Do not confuse with <i>upright</i> (Frame 58).		糸幺小氵土刀亠
憲	constitution, law		宀⺷罒心	constitution	constitution		The key word refers to the fundamental guiding principles of a government or other organization. Its elements: <i>House</i> . . . <i>grow up</i> . . . <i>eyes</i> . . . <i>heart</i>.		心土罒亠宀
毒	poison, virus, venom, germ, harm, injury, spite		龶母	poison	poison		<i>Grow up</i> ... <i>breasts</i>. [8]		土母亠毋


###########  [silage] silage
[silage]						silage	The drawing of this element is difficult to do smoothly, and should be practiced carefully. It is a pictograph of all sorts of plants and grasses thrown together to make <b>silage</b>. The vertical stroke is drawn here with a broken line to indicate that it will always double up with another primitive element’s vertical stroke. [6]		
乗	ride, power, multiplication, record, counter for vehicles, board, mount, join		禾一[silage]	ride	ride		The simplest way to remember this character is to find the sprig of <i>wheat</i> in it, hidden because it doubles up with <i>one</i> stroke of <i>silage</i>.		｜ノ一禾ハ
華	splendor, flower, petal, shine, luster, ostentatious, showy, gay, gorgeous		艹[silage]一	splendor	splendor		Flower ... <i>silage</i> ... needle. [10]		｜一⺾

########### 羽 wings
羽	feathers, counter for birds, rabbits		羽	feathers	feathers	wings	From the pictograph of two bird-<b>wings</b>, we get <b>feathers</b>.	The related image of <i>wings</i> can be added as a primitive meaning. It can also take the form <sup>ョョ</sup> when used as a primitive, as we shall see in frames 618 and 619.	羽冫

########### 爪 claw 
# add claw radical primitive alternative
爪	claw, nail, talon	爫	爪	claw	claw	vulture	This character is a pictograph of a bird's <b>claw</b>, and from there comes to mean animal <b>claws</b> in general (including human fingernails).	As a primitive, we shall use the graphic image of a <i>vulture</i>, a bird known for its powerful <i>claws</i>. It generally appears above another primitive, in which case it gets squeezed into the form ⺥.	爪

###########  [birdhouse] birdhouse
[birdhouse]			爪冖			birdhouse	The <i>claw</i> and crown of the roof of a house (whose chimney is displaced by the <i>claw</i>) combine to give us a <b>birdhouse</b>. [6]		
受	accept, undergo, answer (phone), take, get, catch, receive		爪冖[birdhouse]又	accept	accept		<i>Birdhouse</i> . . . <i>crotch</i>. [8]		爪又冖
愛	love, affection, favourite		爪冖[birdhouse]心夂	love	love		<i>Birdhouse</i> . . . <i>heart</i> . . . <i>walking legs</i>.		心爪冖夂

###########  [quarter] quarter
[quarter]						quarter	This character simply splits the vertical stroke of a half in half once again, to get a <b>quarter</b>. In so doing, it spreads the split stroke out to form a sort of enclosure under which its main relative primitive will be placed. It can be used either in its substantive or verbal meaning. [6]

########## 关 golden calf
# 关 is NOT a 'quarter' but just 'golden calf'
关	frontier pass, close, relation		丷天			golden calf	The story is told of the people of the Exodus that, in their distrust of Moses’ leadership, they gathered together and melted down their gold ornaments to fashion a <b>golden calf</b> for an idol. The <i>animal horns</i> and <i>heavens</i> here represent that god of theirs. [6]		一二人并大

########### 肀 'rake' primitive
肀			ヨ一			rake	A single vertical stroke transforms <i>broom</i> into a <b>rake</b>. When an element comes above the <b>rake</b>, the vertical stroke is shortened, as we have seen before with other similar primitives such as sheep and cow. Moreover, when something comes above the <b>rake</b> and joins to it at the top, the vertical stroke begins at at the top horizontal stroke, as in the following two FRAMEs. [4]		
争	contend, dispute, argue		勹肀	contend	contend		<i>Bound up</i> . . . <i>rake</i>. [6] 		ヨ一亅勹
唐	T'ang, China, foreign		广肀口	T'ang	T'ang		The key word here refers of course to the <b>T'ang</b> Dynasty in China (and not to the name of the drink astronauts take with them into outer space, though this could be useful for the next frame). Its elements: <i>cave</i> . . . <i>rake</i> . . . <i>mouth</i>.		｜ヨ一口广

# 'brush' is not 'rake' !!  Remove 'rake' from its' primitive keywords list and add ⺻ abbreviated form
聿	brush, finally, self, relate, follow, here, fast, writing brush radical (no. 129)	⺻	一肀			brush	This primitive element, not itself a kanji, is a pictograph of a writing <b>brush</b>. Let the first 3 strokes represent the hairs at the tip of the <b>brush</b>, and the following two strokes the thumb and forefinger that guide it when you write. Note how the long vertical stroke, cutting through everything, is drawn last. This is standard procedure when you have such a stroke running the length of a character. However, as we saw in the case of <i>cow</i>, when this primitive appears on top of another primitive, its “tail” is cut off (⺻) [6]		聿
# it's rake, not brush
粛	solemn, quietly, softly		肀米[fenceposts]	solemn	solemn		<i>Rake</i> . . . <i>rice</i> . . . <i>fenceposts</i>. Take special care to draw this character in the same order as the primitive. Note too, that the fourth stroke for <i>rice</i> is already taken care of by the fourth stroke of <i>rake</i>.		｜ノヨ米隶

########### 隶 'sieve' primitive
隶	extend, give, cast, slave radical (no. 171)		肀米			sieve	A <i>rake</i> and the grains of <i>rice</i> at the bottom give us a hint of winnowing, which relates clearly to the meaning of a <b>sieve</b>. [8]		ヨ水隶

########### 隹 turkey primitive
隹	bird, old bird radical (no. 172)					turkey	This primitive is best remembered as an old <b>turkey</b>, complete with pipe and monocle. Its writing is somewhat peculiar, so take note of the order of the strokes. Let the first four strokes stand for the <b>turkey</b>’s head, neck, and drooping chin. The remainder can then be pictographic of the plumage. [8]		隹
唯	solely, only, merely, simply		口隹	solely	solely		<i>Mouth</i> . . . <i>turkey</i>. [11]		口隹

########### 仙 hermit primitive
催	sponsor, hold (a meeting), give (a dinner)		人山隹仙	sponsor	sponsor		<i>Hermit</i> . . . <i>turkey</i>. Note what has happened to the <i>mountain</i> in the element for <i>hermit</i>. In order to make room for the <i>turkey</i>, it was raised and condensed.		⺅山隹

########### 虍 tiger primitive
虎	tiger, drunkard	虍	虍儿	tiger	tiger		The kanji in this frame recalls the famous Bengali fable about the group of magicians (the <i>magic wand</i>) who decided to make a <b>tiger</b>. It seems that each of them knew how to make one part of the beast, so they pooled their talents and brought all the pieces (<i>diced</i> into pieces) together, at which point the fabricated <i>tiger</b> promptly ate its makers up (the bodiless <i>human legs</i>). Whatever the parable's significance for modern civilization and its arsenals, it should help with this kanji. Oh yes, we should not forget that cliff-like element. Think of it as an abbreviation of the primitive for <i>zoo</i> (the first and fourth strokes, actually), in order to fit the <b>tiger</b> somewhere into the picture. In fact, the abbreviation is perfectly logical, since the bottom elements usurp the room for the rest of the primitive for <i>zoo</i>.	As a primitive element itself, the <i>human legs</i> are also swallowed up, but the meaning of <i>tiger</i> is kept, and the whole serves as a roof for what comes beneath 虍, giving the <i>tiger</i> something else to eat.	卜儿匕厂虍

########### 並 'row' primitive
並	row, and, besides, as well as, line up, rank with, rival, equal	[row-bottom][in_a_row_upside_down]	䒑业	row	row	average	This character represents a slightly stylized duplication of the kanji for <i>stand up</i>. By lengthening the sixth and seventh strokes, you will see how this is done.	The primitive meaning remains the same as that of the kanji, but special attention has to be given to the varieties of shape this element can undergo. It is the most difficult one you will meet in this book. When it appears BENEATH its relative primitive, the top three strokes are omitted, though the third horizontal stroke may be doubled up with the bottom horizontal stroke of the element above it (as in 繊 or 湿). ATOP its relative primitive, it can keep its kanji shape. When it does not, the top three strokes are removed and all of them are replaced BELOW the primitive's bottom line (as in 業). We shall acknowledge this latter transformation by changing its meaning to <i>upside down in a row</i>. Editor's note: You can use the row 並 primitive as described by Heisig, or you can switch to use it's basic components 业 (spikes) and 䒑 (grass, weeds) which were not included in RTK. You can decide case by case for each kanji these elements are introduced in.   	｜一二并
僕	me, I (male), servant, manservant		人䒑业夫並	me	me		This key word is yet another synonym for "I," so<b>me</b>what more familiar in tone.

########### 𢦏 thanksgiving primitive
𢦏	to cut, wound, hurt		土戈			thanksgiving	I choose the word <b>Thanksgiving</b> as only one possible way of making this primitive more concrete. The sense, as its composite primitives make clear, is of a <i>“land</i> <i>fiesta</i>,” or a harvest feast. If you choose a word of your own, make sure it does not conflict with <i>fiesta</i>. [6]		ノ十土弋
裁	tailor, judge, decision, cut out (pattern)		十戈𢦏衣	tailor	tailor		You might think here of <i>garment</i> that have been specially <b>tailored</b> for <i>Thanksgiving</i> celebrations to look like traditional Pilgrim garb.		土亠厶戈衣

########### 戍 march primitive
戍	protection		丶戊			march	As distinct from the <i>parade</i>, the <b>march</b> points to a formal demonstration, whose emotions are generally a far cry from the happy spirit of the <i>parade</i>. The inclusion of the one gives the sense of the singlemindedness and unity of the group joined in the <b>march</b>. As was the case with <i>parade</i>, the primitive inside the enclosure indicates who or what is <b>marching</b>. [6]		ノ丶戈厂
威	intimidate, dignity, majesty, menace, threaten		戍女	intimidate	intimidate		Here we see a <i>march</i> of <b>women</b> demonstrating on behalf of equal rights, something extremely <b>intimidating</b> to the male chauvinist population. [9]		ノ女戈厂
感	emotion, feeling, sensation		戍口心	emotion	emotion		<i>Mouth</i>s . . . <i>march</i>ing . . . <i>heart</i>.		ノ口心戈

########### 戊 Parade primitive
戊	5th calendar sign		戈			halberd, parade	Note first the order of the writing. The first stroke, added to <i>fiesta</i>, gives us a full-fledged enclosure, because of which we should always think of this as a <b>parade</b> of something or other, namely whatever is inside the enclosure. [5]		ノ戈
茂	overgrown, grow thick, be luxuriant		艹戊	overgrown	overgrown		The sense of the key word <b>overgrown</b> is of something growing luxuriously, though not necessarily in excess—in this case a whole <i>parade</i> of weeds (outcaste <i>flowers</i>). By way of exception, the <i>flowers</i> take their normal place over the enclosure. [8]		ノ戈⺾
成	turn into, become, get, grow, elapse, reach		戊刀	turn into	turn into		Let the phrase "<b>turn into</b>" suggest some sort of a magical change. What happens here is that the <i>parade</i> marching down main street <b>turns into</b> a <i>dagger</i>-throwing bout between competing bands. Note how only one stroke has to be added to make the change.		ノ戈
越	surpass, cross over, move to, exceed, Vietnam		走戉戊	surpass	surpass		Here we see two <i>parades</i> in competition, each trying to <b>surpass</b> the other by <i>running</i> at high speed from one town to the next. Note the little "hook" at the end of the first stroke of the element for <i>parade</i>. This is the ONLY time it appears like this in the kanji treated in this book.		走土戈
戚	grieve, relatives		上小戊	relatives	relatives		If you think of a <i>parade</i> of particularly disagreeable <b>relatives</b>, it should not be hard to imagine them as large bodies with <i>little</i> pea-brains <i>above</i>.		ノ小卜戈

########### 㦮 float primitive
㦮			戈			float	The <b>floats</b> that are such an important part of a <i>fiesta</i> are shown here by the addition of the two extra horizontal strokes, which you may take as a quasi-pictographic representation of the platform structure of a <b>float</b>. [6]		
桟	scaffold, cleat, frame, jetty, bolt (door)		木㦮	scaffold	scaffold		Prior to the use of metal, <i>trees</i> were once cut down and bound together for use as <b>scaffolding</b> material. In the case of this kanji, what is being constructed is not a skyscraper but a simple <i>float</i>. [10]		ノ毛木丶
銭	coin, .01 yen, money		金㦮	coin	coin		Those special <i>gold</i>-colored tokens minted each year for the Mardi Gras and thrown into the crowds from people on the <i>floats</i> give us the kanji for <b>coins</b>.		ノ金毛丶
浅	shallow, superficial, frivolous, wretched, shameful		水㦮	shallow	shallow		An entourage of <i>floats</i> going from one town to the next must always seek a <b>shallow</b> place to cross the <i>water</i>. Try to picture what happens if they don't.		ノ氵毛丶

########### 歹 bones primitive
歹	bare bone, bad, wrong, death radical (n. 78)					bones	This character is meant to be a pictograph of a <b>bone</b> attached to a piece of flesh (or vice versa.) The first stroke serves to keep it distinct from the character for <i>evening</i> (frame 109). [4]		歹
残	remainder, leftover, balance		歹㦮	remainder	remainder		<i>Bones</i> . . . (parade) <i>float</i>. [10]		ノ毛丶歹
夙	bright and early, long ago, early in life		歹几	earlybird	earlybird				几歹

########### 戈 fiesta primitive
戈	halberd, arms, festival car, float, tasselled spear radical (no. 62)					pike, fiesta	The picture in this primitive is what we may call a “tassled arrow.” A decorative tassle is strung on the shaft of an arrow to indicate that it is no longer a weapon but a symbol of a <b>fiesta</b>. As before, thefirst stroke is extended when it serves as a semi-enclosure. [4]		戈
域	range, region, limits, stage, level		土一口戈	range	range		From its original meaning of a defined area or z<i>one</i>, a <b>range</b> has also come to mean a grazing <i>land</i> where cowboys roam and do whatever it is they do with cows. When the herds have all been driven to market, there is a great homecoming <i>fiesta</i> like that pictured here. As soon as the cowboys come home, home on the <b>range</b>, the first thing they do is kiss the ground (the <i>mouth</i> on the <i>floor</i>), and then get on with the <i>fiesta</i>. [11]		口土戈
賊	burglar, rebel, traitor, robber		貝十戈	burglar	burglar		From a <b>burglar's</b> point of view, a <i>fiesta</i> is an occasion to takeout the old lock picking <i>needle</i> and break into the unat<i>ten</i>ded safe filled with the family <i>shells</i> (the old form of <i>money</i>, as we saw in frames 84 and 206).		貝目ハ十戈
懺	regret, repent, confess sins		人心戈韭	penitential	penitential				人忄戈韭
絨	wool cloth		糸十戈	carpet yarn	carpet yarn				ノ一糸幺小戈

幟	flag, banner, streamer		巾音戈	pennant	pennant				音巾日立戈
籤	lottery, raffle		竹戈韭人	lottery	lottery				竹戈韭人

########### 幺 Cocoon primitive
幺	short thread radical (no. 52)					cocoon	The two triangular shapes here and theirfinal stroke are intended as a pictograph of a <b>cocoon</b>, spun in circles and tied up at the end. It is like the character for thread, except that the silkworm’s actual product has not yet emerged clearly at the bottom. [3]		幺
幾	how many, how much, how far, how long, some, several		人幺戈	how many	how many	abacus	<i>Two cocoons</i> . . . <i>person</i> . . . <i>fiesta</i>.	As a primitive, this kanji will mean an <i>abacus</i>, the bead-instrument used in the Orient to calculate <i>how many</i>.	ノ幺戈丶
胤	descendent, issue, offspring		月儿幺	blood relative	blood relative				月儿幺
聯	party, gang, clique		耳幺	strung together	strung together				耳幺

##### Primitive corrections: water -> rice grains
様	Esq., way, manner, situation, polite suffix		木羊米	Esq.	Esq.		The abbreviation <b>Esq.</b> will help associate this character with the honorific form of address to which it belongs. Its elements are: <i>tree</i> . . . <i>sheep</i> . . . <i>grains of rice</i>. Note that the final vertical stroke in the element for <i>sheep</i> is extended to form the first stroke for <i>grains of rice</i>.		王水并木羊
求	request, want, wish for, require, demand		一丶米	request	request		Let the <i>drop</i> in the upper right-hand corner of this character close the right angle off to make an <i>arrowhead</i>. Whenever we find the <i>needle</i> with that <i>drop</i> in an element that has no other special meaning, we will take advantage of this primitive meaning. At the bottom, we see the <i>grains of rice</i>, the vertical line doubling up for the two elements. Do not confuse with <i>petition</i> (Frame 143).		一水丶
藤	wisteria		艹月[quarter]米	wisteria	wisteria		Flower . . . moon . . . <i>quarter</i> . . . <i>rice grains</i>.		｜一月水⺾

###########  [caverns] caverns
[caverns]			广廿			caverns	The primitive for <b>caverns</b> differs from that for <i>cave</i> by the presence of the <i>twenty</i>, suggesting a maze of underground <i>cave</i>s. [7]		
度	degrees, occurrence, time, counter for occurrences, consider, attitude		广廿又[caverns]	degrees	degrees		This key word refers to a gradation of measurement, not to academic diplomas. Its primitives: <i>caverns</i> . . . <i>crotch</i>.		又广一凵

庶	commoner, all, bastard		[caverns]火	commoner	commoner		<i>Caverns</i> . . . oven <i>fire</i>. [11]		广灬

###########  [deer] deer
鹿	deer	[deer-abbreviated]	广比	deer	deer		Drawn on the walls of a complex of <i>caves</i> near Niaux in southern France are a number of animal likenesses dating from the Upper Paleolithic period. Among them we find pictures of <b>deer</b>, some of them showing men in <b>deer</b> masks. By <i>comparing</i> their drawings to real <b>deer</b>, Stone Age people hoped to acquire power over the animal in the hunt; and by <i>comparing</i> themselves to the <b>deer</b>, to take on that animal's characteristics. But time has locked with a "double-<i>key</i>" (the extra stroke through the element for <i>key</i>) the real secret of this art form from us, and we can only surmise such meanings. But more important than the enigmas of the troglodytic mind is the way in which <i>caves</i>, a double-<i>key</i>, and <i>comparing</i> gives us the kanji for <b>deer</b>.	As a primitive, this kanji is abbreviated much the same as the <i>tiger</i> was: the lower element is dropped to leave room for a replacement: [deer-abbreviated]. Its meaning, however, remains the same. There are a very few cases (see frame 2158) in which there is no abbreviation. When this happens, we may keep the image suggested by the above explanation: <i>painting of a deer</i>.	鹿比广
麗	lovely, beautiful, graceful, resplendent		丽凡一鹿	lovely	lovely		The painting of a <i>deer</i> itself with its form and color is enough to fill the bill for an image of something <b>lovely</b>. But to give a bit of contrast, we see two <i>mediocre</i> drawings from a later age on two patches of <i>ceiling</i> above. Note that the drop in <i>mediocre</i> has been lengthened somewhat and the second stroke drawn down straight.		一鹿比冂广
麓	foot of a mountain		林鹿	foot of a mountain	foot of a mountain		<i>Grove</i> . . . <i>deer</i>.		鹿比木广

########### 𠂤 maestro primitive
𠂤	to store up, to pile up					maestro	To go with this primitive meaning, you might picture a tuxedo-clad <b>maestro</b> waving his baton about wildly. The baton is seen in the drop at the top. And the two boxes attached to the long vertical stroke may represent his tuxedo tails, if you wish. [6]		口
追	chase, drive away, follow, pursue, meanwhile		𠂤辶	chase	chase		<i>Maestro</i> . . . <i>road</i>. [9]		｜口辶

########### 亼 meeting primitive
亼	to assemble. to gather together		一𠆢			meeting	This compound primitive depicts a <b>meeting</b> as a massive gathering of people under <i>one</i> <i>umbrella</i>. The full kanji from which this derives will be introduced later in frame 752. The important thing here is to picture the scene just described and associate it with the word <b>meeting</b>. [3]		一𠆢
今	now		亼	now	now	clock	The final stroke of this kanji is a rare shape, which we have not met before and will only meet in this character and others that include it as a primitive. We are more accustomed to seeing it straightened out as part of other shapes - for instance, as the second stroke of <i>mouth</i>. If you need any help at all with this character, you may picture it as two hands of a <b>clock</b> pointing to what time it is <b>now</b>. The element above it, <i>meeting</i>, should easily relate to that image.	We shall use <i>clock</i> as the primitive meaning of this character, in line with the above explanation.	𠆢一
合	fit, suit, join, 0.1		亼口	fit	fit		The kanji for <b>fit</b> reads literally, top to bottom, as a <i>meeting</i> of <i>mouth</i>s—which is a rather descriptive way of speaking of a romantic kiss. We know what happens when there is no <i>meeting</i> of minds and when people’s ideas don’t <b>fit</b>, but try to imagine what would happen to a poor couple whose <i>mouth</i>s didn’t <b>fit</b>. [6]		口𠆢一

########### 㑒 awl primitive
㑒			亼口人			awl	We include this element here because of its visible similarity to the element for bundle. Be sure to make a distinct image out of its composite ingredients: <i>meeting</i> . . . <i>mouth</i> . . . <i>person</i>. The stroke order follows the order of the elements exactly, but note how the <i>person</i> runs through the <i>mouth</i>. [8]		
剣	sabre, sword, blade, clock hand		㑒刀	saber	saber		<i>Awl</i> . . . <b>saber</b>. As we promised way back in frame 83, here at last is the kanji on which the primitive element of the same name is based. [10]		刂口人𠆢

########### ㄗ chop-seal primitive
マ		ㄗ				ma, chop-seal	The <b>chop-seal</b> (ㄗ) is the engraved piece of wood or stone used in the Orient to certify documents. Unlike the stamp (卩), the top stroke here reaches a good distance to the left of its vertical stroke. When it appears at the top of another primitive, it is abbreviated to マ		
踊	jump, dance, leap, skip		足甬用マ	jump	jump		Wooden <i>leg</i> . . . <i>chop-seal</i> . . . <i>utilize</i>.		口足用マ
令	orders, laws, command, decree, good		亼マ	orders	orders		<i>Meeting</i> ... <i>chop-seal</i>. [5]		𠆢卩一

###########  卩 stamp primitive
### Stamp != fingerprint !!
卩	seal radical (no. 26)					stamp	This character is a kind of pictograph of a <b>stamp</b> that may best be imagined as a postage <b>stamp</b> to distinguish it from other <b>stamp</b>-like things to come up later. [2]		卩
却	instead, on the contrary, rather, step back, withdraw, retreat		去卩	instead	instead		<i>Gone</i> ... <i>stamp</i>. [7]		土卩厶


###########  㔾 fingerprint primitive
### Stamp != fingerprint !!
㔾						fingerprint	The primitive for <b>fingerprint</b> is like that for stamp except that the second stroke bends back towards the right, like an arm. [2]

########### 匚 (small) box primitive
匚	box-on-side enclosure radical (no. 22)	[box-small]				box, hook	This enclosure, open at the right, represents a <b>box</b> lying on its side. When it is not used as an enclosure, its form is cramped to look like this: [<b>box</b>-small]. You may distinguish its meaning by picturing it then as a very small <b>box</b>. [2]		匚
抑	repress, well, now, in the first place, push, shove, press, seal, do in spite of		扌卬匚卩	repress	repress		<i>Fingers</i> . . . <i>box</i> . . . <i>stamp</i>s.		卩扌
仰	face-up, look up, depend, seek, respect, rever, drink, take		人卬匚卩	faceup	faceup		This character is used both for lying on one's back <b>faceup</b>, and for looking up to someone with respect and awe. Its elements: <i>person</i> . . . <i>box</i> . . . <i>stamps</i>.		⺅卩
迎	welcome, meet, greet		卬辶匚卩	welcome	welcome		<i>Box</i> . . . <i>stamp</i>s . . . <i>road</i>.		辶卩
匿	hide, shelter, shield		匚若	hide	hide		<i>Box</i> ... <i>young</i>. [10]		ノ口匚⺾

########### 尞 pup tent
尞	fuel used for sacrifices		癶大小日			pup tent	The <i>St. Bernard dog</i> and its overlapping with the element for <i>teepee</i> are enough to suggest the meaning of this primitive element: a <b>pup tent</b>. The combination of <i>sun</i> and <i>little</i> at the bottom can mean a <i>little</i> opening or flap through which the <i>sun</i> shines in the morning to let you know it’s time for getting up. [12]		丶ノ大小日
僚	colleague, official, companion		人尞	colleague	colleague		<i>Person</i> ... <i>pup tent</i>. Choose some connotation of the key word that will keep it distinct for you from companion (FRAME 19), friend (FRAME 760), consort (FRAME 1287), and comrade (FRAME 1765). [14] 		⺅小日

####### 彡 shape
彡	three, hair ornament, short hair or fur radical (no. 59)					shape	The three simple strokes of this element actually represent the form or <b>shape</b> of the hair of one’s beard. But we keep the simple sense of a <b>shape</b>, or its verb "to <b>shape</b>," in order to avoid confusion later when we meet an element for hair. When using this element, be sure to visualize yourself shaping the thing in question, or better still, twisting it out of <b>shape</b>. [3]		彡
彫	carve, engrave, chisel		周彡	carve	carve		The two primitives here, <i>circumference</i> and <i>shape</i>, belong naturally to the special connotations that differentiate <b>carving</b> from engrave (see FRAME 1639). [11] 		口土冂彡

################ 巴 mosaic
巴	comma-design		巳	comma-design	comma-design	mosaic	This element is shaped roughly like the <i>snake</i>, but pay attention to the difference when writing it. [4]		乙已巴
把	grasp, faggot, bunch, counter for bundles		扌巴	grasp	grasp		<i>Fingers</i> ... <i>mosaic</i>. [7]		巴扌

########### 其 bushel basket
其	that		甘一ハ			bushel basket	As the two <i>legs</i> at the bottom suggest, this <b>bushel basket</b> is a large container, standing on the <i>floor</i>. Its first four strokes indicate that it is made of wicker, much like the small <i>wicker basket</i> introduced just above. To make room for something inside of the <b>bushel basket</b>, the <i>legs</i> at the bottom are attached to the final horizontal stroke and extended to make an enclosure. [8]		一甘ハ
欺	deceit, cheat, delude		其欠	deceit	deceit		<i>bushel basket</i> ... <i>yawn</i>. [12]		甘欠ハ
甚	tremendously, very, great, exceedingly		其匹	tremendously	tremendously		<i>Bushel basket</i> . . . <i>equal</i>. Note how the first stroke of <i>equal</i> doubles up with the sixth stroke of the <i>bushel basket</i>, and how the <i>animal legs</i> of the <i>bushel basket</i> are dropped to make room for the <i>human legs</i> of <i>equal</i>.		一甘儿

############ 且 moreover primitive
且	moreover, also, furthermore			moreover	moreover	shelf	The pictographic representation in the primitive shown here is a small stand with horizontal <b>shelves</b>. Thus we give it the general meaning of a <b>shelf</b>. It differs from the kanji and primitive for an eye only in its final stroke, which extends beyond the two vertical strokes at both ends. Think of it as a <b>shelf</b> for special keepsakes or a glass bureau for knickknacks, keeping it distinct from the kanji we learned in FRAME 202 棚. [5]		一目
組	association, braid, plait, construct, assemble, unite, cooperate, grapple		糸且	association	association		<i>Thread</i> ... <i>shelf</i>. [11] 		一糸幺小目

############# 冓 funnel
冓	put together, inner palace		[celery]再			funnel	<i>Celery</i> . . . <i>again</i>. [10]		｜一冂
講	lecture, club, association		言冓	lecture	lecture		<i>Words</i> ... <i>funnel</i>. [17] 		言冂一十

####### 氐 calling card
氐	name of an ancient tribe		一氏			calling card	<i>Family name</i> . . . <i>floor</i>. [5]		一丶氏
低	lower, short, humble		人氐	lower	lower		<i>Person</i> ... <i>calling card</i>. [7] 		⺅氏

######### 甫 dog tag
甫	for the first time, not until		弋用	offspring		dog tag	This primitive refers to all sorts of identification tags, but <b>dog tag</b> is chosen for its descriptiveness. On the top we see the <i>arrowhead</i> (see 求 request), joined to the <i>screwdriver</i> below by the lengthened vertical stroke. [7]		十用丶
捕	catch, capture		扌甫	catch	catch		<i>Fingers</i> ... <i>dog tag</i>. [10] 		十用丶扌

########## 豆 beans
豆	beans, pea, midget		一口丷	beans	beans	table	This kanji depicts a pot of <b>beans</b>, although it looks more like a <b>table</b> on which the pot is resting.	As a primitive, this kanji will mean <i>table</i>.	口豆并

########### 壴 drum primitive
壴			士豆	drum	drum	drum	The element meaning <b>drum</b> shows a samurai over a <i>table</i>. The top stroke of the <i>table</i> is appears to be missing, but actually it has simply doubled up with the final stroke of the element for samurai. [9		一并十口士豆
鼓	drum, beat, rouse, muster		壴支	drum	drum		The full kanji for the <b>drum</b> adds a <i>branch</i>, apparently to serve as a <i>drum</i>stick, to the primitive for <b>drum</b>. [13]		口士支豆并又十鼓

######## 艮 silver primitive
艮	northeast (Oriental zodiac), stopping, good radical (no. 138)	[silver-left]				silver	We give this element the meaning of <b>silver</b> from the kanji in the following FRAME. Both the original pictographic representation and the primitive elements that make it up are more trouble to hunt out than they are worth. It is best simply to learn it as is. In doing so, take careful note of the stroke order, and also the fact that when this element appears on the left, the penultimate stroke is omitted, giving us simply [<b>silver</b>-left]. [6]		艮
銀	silver		金艮	silver	silver		<i>Metal</i> . . . <b>silver</b>. [14] 		金艮

########### 𠂇 by ones's side primitive
𠂇						side	This primitive has the look of ten, except that the left stroke is bent down toward the left. It indicates where your hands (your ten fingers) fall when you let them droop: by your <b>side</b>. The stroke order of this character can be reversed; but whichever stroke is written second, that stroke should be drawn longer than the other. The difference is slight, and all but unnoticeable in printed characters, but should be learned all the same. [2]		

########### 刖 butcher
刖	cutting off feet as form of punishment		月刂			butcher	We see the elements for flesh and saber, which combine to create a compound element for a <b>butcher</b> and his trade		刂月

###########  [spear] 'spear' primitive 
[spear]						spear	This weapon, which has the appearance of the long saber but is drawn slightly differently, depicts a <b>spear</b>. It appears only rarely--in this book, only twice, and both instances are given in the following FRAMEs. [2]		
班	squad, corps, unit, group		王[spear]王	squad	squad		<i>Spear</i> . . . two <i>ball</i>s. [10] 		王土厂

###########  [fenceposts] fenceposts
[fenceposts]						fenceposts	This element means just what it looks like: two <b>fenceposts</b>. They enclose whatever comes between them, as distinct from a pair of walking sticks (see frame 250). [2]		
斎	purification, Buddhist food, room, worship, avoid, alike		文示[fenceposts]	purification	purification		<i>Plaid</i> . . . <i>fenceposts</i> . . . <i>altar</i>. This is a "religious" <b>purification</b>, which distinguishes it from the simple kanji for <i>pure</i> (Frame 1659 介).		｜ノ文廾斉示二小
斉	adjusted, alike, equal, similar variety of		文[fenceposts]二	adjusted	adjusted		<i>Plaid</i> . . . <i>fenceposts</i> . . . <i>two</i>. Do not confuse with just so (frame 388). [8]		｜ノ文廾斉
済	settle (debt, etc.), relieve (burden), finish, come to an end, excusable, need not		水斉	finish	finish		<i>Water</i> . . . <i>adjust</i>. Do not confuse with <i>complete</i> (Frame 101), <i>end</i> (Frame 1452), or <i>perfect</i> (Frame 199).		｜ノ氵文廾斉
剤	dose, medicine, drug		斉刀	dose	dose		<i>Adjust</i> . . . <i>saber</i>. Think of this as a <b>dose</b> of medicine.		｜ノ刂文廾斉

###########  才  genius
# add 'genie in the bottle' alternative
才	genius, years old, cubic shaku	[genie_in_the_bottle]	才	genius	genius	genie in the bottle	Whatever one is particularly adept at - one's special "<b>genius</b>" - one can do very easily, "with one finger" as the phrase goes. This kanji is a pictograph of that one finger. Note how its distinctive form is created by writing the final stroke of the element for <i>fingers</i> backwards.	The primitive meaning, <i>genie</i>, derives from the roots of the word <i>genius</i>. Use the <i>genie</i> out in the open when the primitive appears to the right of or below its relative primitive; in that case it also keeps its same form. At the left, the form is altered to [genie_in_the_bottle], and the meaning becomes a <i>genie in the bottle</i>.	ノ一亅
在	exist, outskirts, suburbs, located in		才土	exist	exist		<i>Genie in the bottle</i> . . . <i>soil</i>.		｜ノ一土
存	exist, suppose, be aware of, believe, feel		才子	suppose	suppose		<i>Genie in the bottle</i> . . . <i>a child</i>. Hint: focus on the key word's connotation of "make believe".		｜ノ一子


###########  [receipt] primitive
[receipt]						receipt	This primitive element is actually the mirror-image of that for stamp, but since Japanese does not permit a stroke to go to the left and bottom in one swoop, the visual similarity is not perfectly clear. If you play with the idea with pen and paper, its logic will become obvious. [3]		
柳	willow		木[receipt]卩	willow	willow		<i>Tree</i> . . . <i>receipt</i> . . . <i>stamp</i>. [9]		木卩
卵	egg, ovum, spawn, roe		卯丶丶[receipt]卩	egg	egg		<i>Receipt</i> . . . <i>stamp</i> . . . and <i>a drop</i> in each side to represent a little smear of <b>egg</b> yoke. The third stroke is drawn slightly higher to close the <b>egg</b> up tightly and keep the yoke inside.		ノ卜丶卩
留	detain, fasten, halt, stop		[receipt]刀田	detain	detain		<i>Receipt</i> . . . <i>dagger</i> . . . <i>rice field</i>.		田刀厶
貿	trade, exchange		[receipt]刀貝	trade	trade		<i>Receipt</i> . . . <i>dagger</i> . . . <i>shells</i>. Though the meanings are related, do not confuse with <i>make a deal</i> (Frame 471) or <i>wholesale</i> (Frame 1499).		貝目ハ刀厶


###########  旡 waitress primitive
旡	sob, choke, crooked heaven radical variant (no.71)					choke, waitress	If you draw this character once, you will see that its first three strokes resemble the form for receipt (except that the second stroke ends more parallel to the first), with its last stroke stretched to form the first of the two human legs. From this we give it its meaning of a <b>waitress</b> (who should not be confused with the waiter back in FRAME 976 侍). [4]		无
既	previously, already, long ago		艮旡	previously	previously		<i>Silver</i> . . . <i>waitress</i>. Do not confuse this kanji’s key word with before (frame 248). [10] 		牙艮
慨	rue, be sad, sigh, lament		恨旡	rue	rue		<i>Resentment</i> . . . <i>waitress</i>.		牙艮忄

# 无 is NOT 'waitress 旡' (note the missing vertical line)
无	nothing, not exist, crooked heaven radical (no.71)								无


###########  甲 roots primitive
甲	armor, high (voice), A grade, first class, former, instep, carapace		甲	armor	armor	roots	This kanji reverses the element for <i>sprout</i>, giving the image of <b>roots</b> being sent down into the earth by a seed planted in the <i>rice field</i>. From there you must invent a connection to the keyword, <b>armor</b>.	The primitive meaning is <i>roots</i>. Important to that word is the image of "pushing downwards," as <i>roots</i> do. Editor's note: Try to differentiate this from kanji form of <b>roots</b> 根 	｜日田
根	root, radical, head (pimple)		木艮	root	root		<i>Tree</i> . . . <i>silver</i>.	Editor's note: Try to differentiate this from primitive <b>root</b>s 甲	艮木
挿	insert, put in, graft, wear (sword)		扌千甲	insert	insert		<i>Fingers</i> . . . <i>thousand</i> . . . <i>roots</i>. Observe how the writing order does not follow the elements in order, because the final stroke is used for two different elements.		｜ノ十日扌田
概	outline, condition, approximation, generally		根旡	outline	outline		<i>Roots</i> . . . <i>waitress</i>. Note that the kanji meaning of the two primitives to the right is not used here because we shall later meet a primitive meaning <i>beforehand</i> and want to preempt any confusion. The same holds true in the following frame.		牙艮木

########### 川 flood
### Combined with 巛 because it's the same radical. Added [flood-bottom] primitive alternative 
川	stream, river, river or three-stroke river radical (no. 47)	巛[flood-bottom]		stream	stream	flood	We have taken the image of a river <b>stream</b> over into English to describe things that fall down in straight lines, or ripple along in lines. All of this is more than evident in the kanji given here, a pictograph of a <b>stream</b>.	As a primitive, this character adds to the meaning of <i>stream</i> the more vivid image of a <i>flood</i>. Note, however, that there are certain small changes in the writing of the element, depending on where it appears relative to other elements: on the left, it is written the 川. On the top, it is written 巛. On the bottom, it is written [flood-bottom]	川
流	current, a sink, flow, forfeit		水𠫓川	current	current		<i>Water</i> . . . <i>infant</i> . . . <i>flood</i>. Be sure to distinguish the two <i>water</i> primitives from one another in making your story.		氵川亠厶
荒	laid waste, rough, rude, wild		艹亡川	laid waste	laid waste		The <i>flowers</i> that <i>perish</i> in the <i>flood</i> are taken here as symbols of an area that has been <b>laid waste</b>.		川⺾亡
巡	patrol, go around, circumference		川辶	patrol	patrol		A virtual <i>flood</i> of motorcycle police washing down a <i>road</i> is this kanji's image for a <b>patrol</b>.		辶巛
拶	be imminent, draw close		扌川夕	imminent	imminent		<i>Finger</i>s . . . <i>flood</i> . . . <i>evening</i>.		巛夕扌
災	disaster, calamity, woe, curse, evil		川火	disaster	disaster		Of all of nature's <b>disasters</b>, this kanji picks out two of the worst: <i>floods</i> and <i>fires</i>. To recall the disposition of the elements, think of nature's solution to nature's own problem: a great <i>flood</i> pouring down over a great forest <i>fire</i>.		火巛
硫	sulphur		石𠫓川	sulfur	sulfur		<i>Rock</i> . . . <i>infant</i> . . . <i>flood</i>.		口石川亠厶
州	state, province		川丶丶丶	state	state		Here we see <i>drops of</i> land (little islets) rising up out of a <i>stream</i>, creating a kind of sandbar or breakwater. Ever wonder how the <b>state</b>-line is drawn between <b>states</b> separated by a river? If there were little <i>drops of</i> land as in the kanji, there'd be nothing to it.		｜川丶
順	obey, order, turn, right, docility, occasion		川頁	obey	obey		In primitive language, this character would read <i>stream</i> . . . <i>head</i>. And that turns out to be convenient for remembering its meaning of <b>obey</b>. Either one <b>obeys</b> the person who is <i>head</i> of an organization or else <b>obeys</b> by following the <i>stream</i> of opinion ("current" practice, we call it). Both these senses come together in this kanji.		貝目ハ川頁
訓	instruction, Japanese character reading, explanation, read		言川	instruction	instruction		The personalism connoted by the word <b>instruction</b>, as opposed to "teaching" or "discipline," suits the picture here of <i>words</i> guiding one's progress like the gentle flowing of a <i>stream</i>. Even the etymology of the word <b>instruction</b> suggests the sense of "pouring into".		言川
馴	get used to, experienced, tamed		馬川	tame	tame				川灬馬

# duplicate
巛	curving river radical (no.47)	川				 			巛

###########  [wall] wall
[wall]						wall	The elbow hanging under a ceiling will become our element for a <b>wall</b>. [3]		
会	meeting, meet, party, association, interview, join		𠆢云亼[wall]	meeting	meeting		<i>Meeting</i> ... <i>wall</i>. This is the full character for <b>meeting</b>, from which the abbreviated primitive that we met back in Lesson 12 gets its name. [6]		二𠆢厶

######### 夬 guillotine primitive
夬	decide, determine, archery glove		ユ大	guillotine	guillotine	guillotine	This element depicts a <i>large</i>, sharpened <i>key</i> coming down on the head of a criminal St. Bernard. [4]		人大二ユ
決	decide, fix, agree upon, appoint		水夬	decide	decide		The etymology of <b>decide</b> (de-cidere = cut off ) will help here; the elements are: <i>water</i> . . . <i>guillotine</i>. [7]		氵人大二

############### ユ key primitive
ユ						key	This element gets its name and meaning from its pictographic representation of a <b>key</b>. The shape should be familiar: it is none other than the third and fourth strokes of the kanji for five. [2]		
侯	marquis, lord, daimyo		人ユ矢	marquis	marquis		<i>Person</i> . . . <i>key</i> . . . <i>dart</i>. Hint: the pun suggested by the pronunciation of the <i>key</i> word and the primitive for <i>key</i> may come in helpful. [9] 		⺅矢


############### 韋 locket primitive
韋	tanned leather radical (no. 178)		ユ口ヰ			locket	The vertical stroke added here (the third stroke) turns the primitive element for a <i>key</i> into a <b>locket</b>. Below that, wefind a square container (the <i>mouth</i>) and sunglasses with one of the lenses popped out. Note that in the primitive element for <b>locket</b> thefinal vertical stroke of sunglasses reaches all the way through to touch the <i>mouth</i>. [10]		韋口
偉	admirable, greatness, remarkable, conceited, famous, excellent		人韋	admirable	admirable		<i>Person</i> . . . <i>locket</i>. [12]		⺅口韋

############# 舛 'sunglasses' primitive
舛	dancing radical (no. 136)		夕ヰ			sunglasses	These two elements are actually the full form whose abbreviation we learned as the character for measuring box in frame 42. To the left, we see the familiar shape of <i>evening</i>, and to the right a completely new shape. The meaning we have assigned, <b>sunglasses</b>, is entirely arbitrary. [7]		舛夕
瞬	wink, blink, twinkle		目[birdhouse]舛	wink	wink		<i>Eye</i> . . . <i>birdhouse</i> . . . <i>sunglasses</i>. [18]		牛舛爪目夕冖
憐	pity, have mercy, sympathise, compassion		心舛米	sympathize with	sympathize with				舛米忄夕

############# ヰ 'sunglasses with a lens popped out'.   
ヰ						sunglasses with a lens popped out			
年	year, counter for years		午ヰ	year	year		In an odd fashion, the kanji for <b>year</b> joins together the element for <i>horse</i>, on the top, and the right half of the element for <i>sunglasses</i>. Think of it as a <i>horse</i> wearing <i>sunglasses with one of the lenses popped out</i>. We will use this latter image again, so learn it now and save yourself the trouble later.		ノ一干

########## 咅 'muzzle' primitive
咅	to spit out		立口	muzzle	muzzle	muzzle	The element for <b>muzzle</b> shows a <i>vase</i>fixed over a <i>mouth</i>, perhaps with a rubber band running around the back of the head to keep it in place. [8]		口立
倍	double, twice, times, fold		人咅	double	double		<i>Person</i> . . . <i>muzzle</i>. Do not confuse with the kanji for <i>duplicate</i> (Frame 504).		⺅口立
培	cultivate, foster		土咅	cultivate	cultivate		The barrel hoops used by many Japanese farmers to stretch clear plastic over row of vegetables in a garden patch in the hopes of <b>cultivating</b> bigger and bigger vegetables is a way of <i>muzzling</i> the <i>soil</i>.		口土立
剖	divide		咅刀	divide	divide		To "<b>divide</b> and conquer" you use a <i>saber</i> and a <i>muzzle</i>.		刂口立
賠	compensation, indemnify		貝咅	compensation	compensation		Picture a <i>clam</i> used as a <i>muzzle</i> to quiet the complaints of a fisherman's widow asking <b>compensation</b> for her husband lost at sea.		貝目ハ口立
菩	kind of grass, sacred tree		艹咅	bo tree	bo tree				口立⺾


########## 圥 'rice seedlings' primitive
圥	mushroom					rice seedlings	As we mentioned back in frame 234, <b>rice seedlings</b> get an element all their own: soil and man legs becomes an ideograph of the spikelets of rice bunched together for implanting in the muddy soil of the paddy. [5]		儿土

####### ⻏ 'city walls' primitive 
### (NOTE this is written in the RIGHT side: Unicode Id 11983 - CJK RADICAL CITY)
⻏	village, rural community, right village radical (no. 163)	邑		city walls	city walls		On the left, and rather more pressed in its form (⻖), this element meant the high spot of a village, or its pinnacle. On the right side, in the form shown here(⻏), it means the lowest part of the city, around which its walls rise up as a protection against invaders. Hence we nickname this element: <b>city walls</b>. [3]		

邸	residence, mansion		氐⻏	residence	residence		<i>Calling card</i> . . . <i>city walls</i>. [8]		氏⻏

# This is not the form of 'city walls' primitive Heisig uses, even though it is semantically the same right village radical
邑	village, rural community, right village radical (no. 163)	⻏			 				口巴


####### ⻖ 'pinnacle' primitive 
### (NOTE this is written in the LEFT side: Unicode Id 11990 - CJK RADICAL MOUND TWO)
⻖	place, left village radical (no. 170)					pinnacle	This key word has been chosen because of its connotation of “the highest point,” thereby suggesting the image of the highest point in a village, that is, a hill or mountain on which sacred or festive events take place. If you have a clear image of the Athenian acropolis, you might use it to express this element for a <b>pinnacle</b>. Note that this primitive (⻖) appears only on the left. On the right, as we shall see later, the same form takes a different meaning (⻏ city walls). [3]		
陪	obeisance, follow, accompany, attend on		⻖咅	auxiliary	auxiliary		<i>Pinnacle</i> . . . <i>muzzle</i>.		口立⻖
隊	regiment, party, company, squad		⻖丷豕	regiment	regiment		<i>Pinnacle</i> . . . <i>animal horns</i> . . . <i>sow</i>.		并豕⻖

隠	conceal, hide, cover		⻖爪ヨ心	conceal	conceal		<i>Pinnacle</i> . . . <i>vulture</i> . . . <i>broom</i> . . . <i>heart</i>. Compare the element sat the right to the kanji for <i>calm</i> (Frame 1230).		ノヨ⺌心⻖
院	Inst., institution, temple, mansion, school		⻖完	Inst.	Inst.		This key word, the abbreviation for <b>Institution</b>, represents the use of that word as a suffix affixed to certain buildings and organizations. Its primitive elements: <i>pinnacle</i> . . . <i>perfect</i>.		二儿宀⻖元
降	descend, precipitate, fall, surrender		⻖夂ヰ	descend	descend		<i>Pinnacle</i> . . . <i>walking legs</i> . . . <i>sunglasses with a lens popped out</i>. Distinguish from <i>fall</i> (Frame 320) and <i>crash</i>, which we considered in the previous frame.		夂⻖十
除	exclude, division (x/3), remove, abolish, cancel, except		⻖余	exclude	exclude		<i>Pinnacle</i> . . . <i>scale</i>.		禾𠆢⻖
際	occasion, side, edge, verge, dangerous, adventurous, indecent, time, when		⻖祭	occasion	occasion		<i>Pinnacle</i> . . . <i>ritual</i>.		際ノ示二小癶⻖
階	storey, stair, counter for storeys of a building		⻖皆	story	story		The <b>story</b> of this character refers to floors in a building. The elements: <i>pinnacle</i> . . . <i>all</i>.		白比⻖
防	ward off, defend, protect, resist		⻖方	ward off	ward off		<i>Pinnacle</i> . . . <i>compass</i>.		方⻖
陽	sunshine, yang principle, positive, male, heaven, daytime		⻖昜	sunshine	sunshine		Different from the primitive for <i>sun</i> (which figures in the character) and the kanji for <i>ray</i> (Frame 125), the key word <b>sunshine</b> is meant to convey the meaning of the masculine principle in nature, or "Yang." (The dark is viewed mythically as the feminine principle; see frame 1718.) From there it comes to mean <i>sun</i> also. The elements are: <i>pinnacle</i> . . . <i>piggy bank</i>.		一日勿⻖
障	hinder, hurt, harm		⻖章	hinder	hinder		<i>Pinnacle</i> . . . <i>badge</i>.		音十日立⻖
隣	neighboring		⻖米舛	neighboring	neighboring		<i>Pinnacle</i> . . . <i>rice</i> . . . <i>sunglasses</i>.		舛米夕⻖
陸	land, six		⻖圥土	land	land		The sense of <b>land</b> carried by this kanji is distinct from <i>soil</i> (frame 150) and ground (frame 515) in that it is meant to represent <i>land</i> seen from a distance, that is, <b>land</b> as opposed to “water.” Its elements: <i>pinnacle</i> . . . <i>rice seedlings</i> . . . ground. [11]		土儿⻖
陛	highness, steps (of throne)		⻖比土	highness	highness		This key word indicates a title of address to royalty. Its elements: <i>pinnacle</i> . . . <i>compare</i> . . . <i>ground</i>.		土比⻖
陰	shade, yin, negative, sex organs, secret, shadow		⻖今云	shade	shade		Just as the <i>sunshine</i> (Frame 1397) represents the masculine principle in nature (Yang), the <b>shade</b> stands for the feminine principle (Yin). Its elements are: <i>pinnacle</i> . . . <i>clock</i> . . . <i>rising cloud</i>.		二𠆢厶⻖
阿	Africa, flatter, fawn upon, corner, nook, recess		⻖可	Africa	Africa		This kanji, an abbreviation for <b>Africa</b>, is now used chiefly for its sound, "a," not unlike the kanji for <i>Italy</i> and the sound "i" that we met earlier (Frame 1245). Its composite elements are: <i>pinnacles</i> . . . <i>can</i>.		一口亅⻖
陣	camp, battle array, ranks, position, sudden, brief time		⻖車	camp	camp		<i>Pinnacle</i> . . . <i>car</i>.		車⻖
随	follow, though, notwithstanding, while, during, both, all, obey, submit to, comply, at the mercy of (the waves)		⻖有辶	follow	follow		<i>Pinnacle</i> . . . <i>possess</i> . . . <i>road</i>.		ノ一月辶⻖
陥	collapse, fall into, cave in, fall (castle), slide into		⻖勹旧	collapse	collapse		<i>Pinnacle</i> . . . <i>bound up</i> . . . <i>olden times</i>.		｜日勹⻖
隔	isolate, alternate, distance, separate, gulf		⻖鬲一口儿冂丁	isolate	isolate		<i>Pinnacle</i> . . . <i>ceiling</i> . . . <i>mouth</i> . . . <i>glass canopy</i> . . . <i>human legs</i> . . . <i>spike</i>. You might want to compare the kanji for <i>dissolve</i> (Frame 1123).		一口儿冂⻖鬲
阻	thwart, separate from, prevent, obstruct, deter, impede		⻖且	thwart	thwart		<i>Pinnacle</i> . . . <i>shelf</i>.		一目⻖
隙	crevice, fissure, discord, opportunity, leisure		⻖小日小	chink	chink		<i>Pinnacle</i> . . . <i>little</i> . . . <i>sun</i> . . . <i>little</i>. Note that the form of the first element for <i>little</i> given here is the simpler form that has become standard in general-use characters (See Frame 110). For the time being, until typesetting fonts have made the adjustment, the official approved drawing has the drops similar to the bottom <i>little</i>.		小日⻖
阪	heights, slope		⻖反	Heights	Heights		This character is used for proper names, much as the English word “<b>Heights</b>” is. Its primitives: <i>pinnacle</i> . . . <i>anti-</i>. [7]		又厂⻖
隅	corner, nook		⻖禺	corner	corner		<i>Pinnacle</i> . . . <i>Talking Cricket</i>.		田日冂厶禸⻖
隆	hump, high, noble, prosperity		⻖夂生	hump	hump		This character, used for everything from little <b>humps</b> of hills to camel <b>humps</b>, easily suggests the hunch on the pig's back and hind parts where the best cuts of meat are to be found (and hence the English expression for luxury, "living high off the hog.") The elements we have to work with are: <i>pinnacle</i> . . . <i>walking legs</i> . . . <i>cell</i>.		生夂⻖
堕	degenerate, descend to, lapse into		⻖有土	degenerate	degenerate		<i>Pinnacle</i> . . . <i>possess</i> . . . ground.		ノ一月土⻖

限	limit, restrict, to best of ability		⻖艮	limit	limit		<i>Pinnacle</i> . . . <i>silver</i>.		艮⻖

# This is not the form of 'pinnacle' primitive Heisig uses, even though it is semantically the same left village radical
阜	hill, mound, left village radical (no. 170)	⻖	𠂤十	large hill	large hill		<i>Maestro</i> ... <i>needle</i>. [8]		⻖十


###########  [tool] tool primitive
[tool]						tool	Although this primitive is not very common, it is useful to know, as the following examples will show. Conveniently, it is always drawn at the very bottom of any kanji in which itfigures. Thefirst stroke, the horizontal one, is detached from anything above it, but is necessary to distinguish <b>tool</b> from animal legs. The sense of the element is a carpenter’s <b>tool</b>, which comes from its pictographic representation of a small table with legs (make them animal legs if you need a more graphic image), so that any element lying on top of it will come to be viewed as a <b>tool</b> in the hands of a carpenter. [3]		
具	tool, utensil, means, possess, ingredients, counter for armor, suits, sets of furniture		目[tool]丌	tool	tool		Here is the full kanji on which the last frame is based. If you can think of a table full of carpenter's <b>tools</b> of all sorts, each equipped with its own <i>eye</i> so that it can keep a watch over what you are doing with it, you won't have trouble later keeping the primitive and the kanji apart.		一ハ目
興	entertain, revive, retrieve, interest, pleasure		臼同[tool]丌	entertain	entertain		<i>Mortar</i> . . . <i>same</i> . . . <i>tool</i>. Be careful to make an image that keeps <i>same</i> in the middle.		臼口ハ冂一
挙	raise, plan, project, behavior, actions		⺍[tool]手	raise	raise		<i>Owl</i> . . . <i>tool</i> . . . <i>hand</i>.		手⺌ハ
典	code, ceremony, law, rule		曲[tool]	code	code		We introduce this character here because of its connection to the book-related kanji treated above. It is based on the character for <i>bend</i> (frame 1256), whose last stroke is lengthened to coincide with the first stroke of the element for <i>tool</i>.		｜一日ハ
誉	reputation, praise, honor, glory		⺍[tool]言	reputation	reputation		<i>Owl</i> . . . <i>tool</i> . . . <i>say</i>ing.		一言⺌并
呉	give, do something for, kingdom of Wu		口[tool]	give	give		The complex of strokes in this kanji is unusual and difficult, because of the fourth stroke, which is rare (see frames 33 and 34). The <i>mouth</i> and <i>tool</i> are already familiar.		口ハ


###########  [siesta] siesta
[siesta]			日勹匕			siesta	Conjure up the classic portrait of the Latin <b>siesta</b>: a muchacho <i>sitting on the ground</i>, propped up against some building, <i>bound up</i> from neck to ankles in a serape, one of those great, broad- rimmed mariachi hats pulled down over his face, and the noon<i>day</i> <i>sun</i> beating down overhead. Always use the complete image, never simply the general sense of <b>siesta</b>. [8]		
掲	put up (a notice), put up, hoist, display, hang out, publish, describe		扌日匂[siesta]	put up a notice	put up a notice		<i>Fingers</i> . . . <i>siesta</i>.		日勹匕扌
渇	thirst, dry up, parch		水日匂[siesta]	thirst	thirst		As you pass by the muchacho taking the <i>siesta</i>, he cries out that he is <b>thirsty</b> and asks for something to drink. So you turn the <i>water</i> hose on him. [11]		氵日勹匕
葛	arrowroot, kudzu		艹日匂[siesta]	kudzu	kudzu		<b>Kudzu</b> is a word taken over from Japanese to name the crawling vines that creep up and completely take over trees. Seeing it at its worst in the Georgia countryside makes it easy to understand why it has a reputation as the "plague of the South." From there it should not be hard to arrange the primitives, <i>flowers</i> and <i>siesta</i> into a memorable image.		日勹匕⺾
喝	hoarse, scold		口日匂[siesta]	hoarse	hoarse		When the muchacho on <i>siesta</i> looks up at you and opens his <i>mouth</i> to talk, his voice is so <b>hoarse</b> that you cannot understand him.		口日勹匕
謁	audience, audience (with king)		言日匂[siesta]	audience	audience		Imagine an <b>audience</b> with the emperor or the pope in which all those in attendance are sitting down, leaning against the wall, sleeping like our muchacho on <i>siesta</i> as the honorable host delivers his <i>speech</i>.		言日勹匕
褐	brown, woollen kimono		衣日匂[siesta]	brown	brown		The color of the serape or <i>cloak</i> of our muchacho on <i>siesta</i> is a dull <b>brown</b>, the color this kanji indicates.		衤日勹匕

###########  [outhouse] outhouse
[outhouse]			小冖口			outhouse	The combination of the element for <i>little</i>, the basic "roof" structure here (in which the chimney was overwritten, as it was in the element for vulture), combined with the "window" (<i>mouth</i>) below, gives this element its meaning of <b>outhouse</b>. Although the window is not an essential part of an <b>outhouse</b>, I think you will agree that its inclusion is a boon to the imagination, greatly simplifying the learning of the characters in which it appears. [8]		
賞	prize, reward, praise		[outhouse]貝	prize	prize		<i>Outhouse</i> . . . <i>shellfish</i>. [15] 		貝目ハ口⺌冖
党	party, faction, clique		[outhouse]儿	party	party		Think of this key word as referring to a political <b>party</b>, not a gala affair. Its elements: <i>human legs</i> . . . sticking out of an <i>outhouse</i> window.		口⺌儿冖
裳	skirt		[outhouse]衣	skirt	skirt		The key word refers to an ancient <b>skirt</b> once used as part of a woman's costume. The primitives you have to work with are: <i>outhouse</i> . . . <i>garment</i>.		衣口⺌冖
常	usual, ordinary, normal, common, regular, continually, always, long-lasting		[outhouse]巾	usual	usual		<i>Outhouse</i> . . . <i>towel</i>.		巾口⺌冖
堂	public chamber, hall		[outhouse]土	public chamber	hall		<i>Outhouse</i> . . . <i>land</i>.		口⺌土冖
掌	manipulate, rule, administer, conduct, palm of hand		[outhouse]手	manipulate	manipulate		<i>Outhouse</i> . . . <i>hand</i>.		口手⺌冖

# this kanji 尚, even though looks a bit like 'outhouse', is not (this has 'glass canopy/hood' and 'outhouse' has 'roof'
尚	esteem, furthermore, still, yet		尚	esteem	esteem		Above we see the primitive for <i>little</i> attached to one of those <i>glass canopies</i> you might use to display a family heirloom. The <i>littleness</i> is important, because what is in fact on display is the shrunken, stuffed, and mounted <i>mouth</i> of an <b>esteemed</b> ancestor. We may be used to <b>esteeming</b> the words our forebears leave behind, but here we also <b>esteem</b> the very <i>mouth</i> that spoke them. I leave it to you to imagine a suitable place in your room for displaying such an unusual conversation piece.		口⺌冂

###########  [spring] spring
泉	spring, fountain	[spring-small]	白水	spring	spring		Call to mind the image of a fresh, bubbling <b>spring</b> of <i>water</i>, and you will probably notice how the top of the <b>spring</b> you are thinking of, the part where the "bubbling" goes on, is all <i>white</i>. Happily, the <i>white</i> is just where it should be, at the top, and the <i>water</i> is at the bottom.	We will keep this image of a <i>spring</i> when using this kanji as a primitive, but not without first drawing attention to a slight change that distinguishes the primitive from the kanji. The final 4 strokes (the element for <i>water</i>) are abbreviated to the three small drops that we learned earlier as the kanji for <i>little</i>, giving us [spring-small]	水白
原	meadow, original, primitive, field, plain, prairie, tundra, wilderness		厂白小泉	meadow	meadow		Though the kanji is broad enough to embrace both meanings, the <b>meadow</b> you should imagine here is not a flatland plain but a mountain <b>meadow</b> in the Austrian Alps. (Perhaps the opening scene of "The Sound of Music" will help.) Simply think of <i>little</i> <i>springs</i> bubbling up across the <b>meadow</b> to form a sort of path that leads you right to the brink of a precipitous <i>cliff</i>. Now if you can see Schwester Maria skipping along merrily, dodging in and out of the <i>springs</i>, and then falling headlong over the <i>cliff</i>, you have a ridiculous story that should help fix this kanji in memory.		小白厂

###########  [pegasus] pegasus
[pegasus]						pegasus	By combining the horse (giving a twist to its final stroke a bit to the left to keep the strokes from overlapping) with the turkey, we get a flying horse or <b>Pegasus</b>. Be sure not to confuse with the turkey house 隺 from frame 567. [11]		
観	outlook, look, appearance, condition, view		[pegasus]見	outlook	outlook		<i>Pegasus</i> . . . <i>see</i>.		見隹矢
権	authority, power, rights		木[pegasus]	authority	authority		<i>Tree</i> . . . <i>Pegasus</i>.		矢木隹
歓	delight, joy		[pegasus]欠	delight	delight		Again I cannot resist sharing my own associations. If you’ve ever seen Disney’s animated interpretation of classical music, “Fantasia,” you will recall what was done there with Beethoven’s “Pastoral Symphony” (the 6th), and the flying horses thatfigured in it. The mares are bathing in the stream and the stallions begin to gather. As dusk sets in, the flying horses all start <i>yawn</i>ing and pair off for the night: a perfectly <b>delight</b>ful portrait of <b>delight</b>. [15]		欠隹矢
勧	persuade, recommend, advise, encourage, offer		[pegasus]力	persuade	persuade		<i>Pegasus</i> . . . <i>power</i>.		ノ力隹矢
潅	pour into, irrigate, shed (tears), flow into, concentrate on		水潅	souse	souse				氵隹矢

########### 隺 'turkey house' primitive
### this is NOT 'pegasus' but 'turkey house'
隺	bird flying, high ambition		冖隹			turkey house	Taking careful note of the unusual stroke order that has the "chimney" on the <i>house</i> doubled up with the first stroke of the <i>turkey</i>, we may see this as a <i>turkey house</i> (or "<i>coop</i>"). 		冖隹
確	assurance, firm, tight, hard, solid, confirm, clear, evident		石隺	assurance	assurance		On the left you see the <i>rock</i>, which is familiar enough. But pay attention to the right. Taking careful note of the unusual stroke order that has the "chimney" on the <i>house</i> doubled up with the first stroke of the <i>turkey</i>, we may see the right side as a <i>turkey house</i> (or "<i>coop</i>"). We shall see this pattern only on one other occasion (Frame 2093), but even for these two characters it is well worth the trouble to single it out as a primitive.		口石宀隹
鶴	crane, stork		隺鳥	crane	crane		<i>Turkey house</i> . . . <i>bird</i>. The first element appears on only one other occasion, back in frame 609.		鳥灬隹宀


###########  [condor] condor
[condor]			爪王山			condor	<i>Vulture</i> . . . <i>king</i> . . . <i>mountain</i>. By now you should be used to finding two elements double up on a stroke, as is the case here with <i>king</i> and <i>mountain</i>. [9]		
揺	swing, shake, sway, rock, tremble, vibrate		扌[condor]	swing	swing		<i>Fingers</i> . . . <i>condor</i>. [12]		干爪凵扌
謡	song, sing, ballad, noh chanting		言[condor]	Noh chanting	Noh chanting		<i>Words</i> . . . <i>condor</i>.		干言爪凵

# 䍃 is NOT a 'condor'
䍃	a vase, a pitcher, earthenware								丶凵夕山缶

###########  [oaken_tub] oakentub
[oaken_tub]	 					oaken tub	A pictograph of an <b>oaken tub</b> ribbed with metal strips, like the kind once used for bathing.		｜一
無	nothingness, none, ain't, nothing, nil, not		𠂉[oaken_tub]灬	nothingness	nothingness		This character is the Japanese character for the supreme philosophical principle of much Oriental thought: <b>nothingness</b>. Make use of the oaken <i>tub</i> from the previous frame, and add to that the <i>oven fire</i> at the bottom.		｜ノ一灬無
舞	dance, flit, circle, wheel		𠂉[oaken_tub]舛	dance	dance		The top two strokes show someone <i>reclining</i>, and the next six are a pictograph of an oaken <i>tub</i> ribbed with metal strips, like the kind once used for bathing. At the bottom, the <i>sunglasses</i> round off the character.		｜ノ一舛二夕無

###########  [banner] banner
[banner]			方𠂉			banner	Here we have a unique enclosure made up of two elements: <i>compass</i> and <i>reclining</i>. Think of the <b>banner</b> as a standard for rallying around; then imagine a crowd <i>reclining</i> before a <i>compass</i> (presumably to give them a "<i>direction</i>" in life). [6]		ノ方一
施	give, bestow, perform, alms		[banner]也	alms	alms		<i>Banner</i> . . . <i>scorpion</i>		ノ方一也
族	tribe, family		[banner]矢	tribe	tribe		<i>Banner</i> . . . <i>dart</i>.		方矢

旗	national flag, banner, standard		[banner]其	national flag	national flag		<i>Banner</i> . . . <i>bushel basket</i>.		甘ハ方

############ 目 (eye) is not the same as 罒 (net)
目	eye, class, look, insight, experience, care, favor		目	eye	eye		Here again, if we round out the corners of this kanji and curve the middle strokes upwards and downwards respectively, we get something resembling an <b>eye</b>.	As a primitive, the kanji keeps its sense of <i>eye</i>, or more specifically, an <i>eyeball</i>. When placed in the surroundings of a complex kanji, the primitive will sometimes be turned on its side (罒).  Editor's note: The eye turned on its side 罒 has a different meaning (net) and it will be referenced as a separate primitive. For each kanji you can use either Heisig's mnemonics (which doesn't differentiate the two) or substitute a different keyword to your own story.	目

罒	net radical variant (no. 122)	网				eye		Editor's note: This net radical 罒 (referred by Heisig as eye turned on its side) a different meaning from the normal eye kanji (目). We'll keep these as separate primitives, but for each kanji you can use either Heisig's mnemonics (which doesn't differentiate the two) or substitute a different keyword to your own story using this 罒 primitive. Suggestions: Spider's net, internet or fishing net.	罒
置	placement, put, set, deposit, leave behind, keep, employ, pawn		罒直	placement	placement		<i>Eye</i> . . . <i>straightaway</i>.		十罒目一｜
買	buy		罒貝	buy	buy		<i>Eye</i> . . . <i>shellfish</i>.		貝目ハ罒
夢	dream, vision, illusion		艹罒冖夕	dream	dream		To have a <b>dream</b> after going to bed is really the <i>crown</i> to a perfect <i>evening</i>. The <i>flower</i> petals over the <i>eyes</i> (instead of the "sand" that Westerners are used to finding there when they awake in the morning) only confirms the image of a pleasant <b>dream</b> suggested by the rest of this rather complex kanji.		罒夕冖⺾
罪	guilt, sin, crime, fault, blame, offense		罒非	guilt	guilt		<i>Eye</i> . . . <i>jail cell</i>.		罒非
壊	demolition, break, destroy		土十罒衣	demolition	demolition		The right half of this character shows a <i>garment</i> woven so fine that it can pass through the <i>eye</i> of a <i>needle</i>, fittingly draped around the slithering, ethereal form of a poltergeist. In this frame, our eerie visitor brushes its robes against a nearby block of apartments and completely <b>demolishes</b> them, razing them to the <i>ground</i>.		衣十土罒
聴	listen, headstrong, naughty, careful inquiry		耳十罒心	listen	listen		<i>Ear</i> . . . <i>needle</i> . . . <i>eye</i> . . . <i>heart</i>. Compare frame 427 for this and the following kanji, and then once again when you get to frame 950.		耳十心罒

徳	benevolence, virtue, goodness, commanding respect		彳十罒心	benevolence	benevolence		<i>Going</i> . . . <i>needle</i> . . . <i>eye</i> . . . <i>heart</i>. Refer back now to the note in frame 890.		十心罒彳

罵	abuse, insult		罒馬	insult	insult		<i>Eye</i>ball . . . team of <i>horse</i>s.		馬罒
蔑	ignore, despise, neglect, ridicule		艹罒戍	revile	revile		The verbal abuse involved in <b>reviling</b> those who do not deserve it can be compared to a <i>march of flowers</i> in full boom having an <i>eyeball</i> of nastiness cast over them (literally, of course).		ノ罒戈⺾
濁	voiced, uncleanness, wrong, nigori, impurity		水罒勹虫	voiced	voiced		The key word for this kanji connotes the "muddying" effect on a soft consonant brought about by vibrating the vocal chords. For example, in English a "j" is <b>voiced</b> while a "sh" is un<b>voiced</b>. In Japanese, the し is changed to じ when it is <b>voiced</b>. The primitives are: <i>water</i> . . . <i>eye</i> . . . <i>bound up</i> . . . <i>insect</i>.		氵虫罒勹
罷	quit, stop, leave, withdraw, go		罒能	quit	quit				月罒匕厶

# this is a duplicate

############# 厂 cliff primitive
厂	wild goose, trailing cliff radical (no. 27)	丆				cliff	This primitive means precisely what it looks like: a steep <b>cliff</b>. You can almost see someone standing at the top looking down into the abyss below. [2]		厂
石	stone		厂口	stone	stone	rock	With a <i>mouth</i> under a <i>cliff</i>, what else could we have here but the entrance to a secret cavern, before which a great <b>stone</b> has been rolled so that none may enter. Perhaps it is the hiding place where Ali Baba and his band of thieves have stored their treasures, in which case that magic word known to every school child who ever delighted over the tales of the <i>Arabian Nights</i> should be enough to push the <b>stone</b> aside. But take care - the <i>cliff</i> is steep, and one slip will send you tumbling down into the ravine below. This is the one and only time that the second stroke in <i>cliff</i> will reach over to the middle of the horizontal stroke. If you think of the edge jutting outwards (in keeping with the story above), the problem should be taken care of.	The <i>stone</i> is a quite common primitive element, which is not restricted to great boulders but used of <i>stones</i> or <i>rocks</i> of any size or shape.	口石

############ 専 specialty
専	specialty, exclusive, mainly, solely		十田寸	specialty	specialty		<i>Ten</i> . . . <i>rice fields</i> . . . <i>glue</i>. That is how one would read the primitive elements of this kanji from top to bottom. Now if we make a simple sen<i>ten</i>ce out of these elements, we get: "<i>Ten rice fields glued</i> together." A <b>specialty</b>, of course, refers to one's special "<i>field</i>" of endeavor or competence. In fact, few people remain con<i>ten</i>t with a single <b>specialty</b> and usually ex<i>ten</i>d themselves in other <i>fields</i> as well. This is how we come to get the picture of <i>ten fields glued</i> together to represent a <b>specialty</b>.		十寸田
# this 尃 is NOT specialty 専 !! (note the added extra drop) but actually the 'acupuncturist' Heisig refers to in 'Dr 博'. However it is so rare that we don't refer to it as a separate entity
尃	to state to, to announce		十田寸			acupuncturist		Editor's note: This kanji in fact is the 'acupuncturist' (a doctor without his needle) referred to in 博 (Dr.) by Heisig.	一｜丶十寸日
博	Dr., command, esteem, win acclaim, Ph.D., exposition, fair		十専丶尃	Dr.	Dr.		At the left we have the <i>needle</i>; at the right, the kanji for <i>specialty</i>, plus an extra <i>drop</i> at the top. Think of a <b>Dr.</b> who is a <i>specialist</i> with a <i>needle</i> (an <i>acupuncturist</i>) and let the <i>drop</i> at the top represent the period at the end of <b>Dr.</b> In principle we are trying to avoid this kind of device, which plays on abstract grammatical conventions; but I think you will agree, after you have had occasion to use the right side of this kanji in forming other kanji, that the exception is merited in this case.	The primitive form of this kanji eliminates the <i>needle</i> on the left and gets the meaning of an <i>acupuncturist</i>. Editor's note: The '<i>acupuncturist</i>' here actually has its own kanji 尃 (to state, to announce) which we keep as a separate entity 	十寸田丶


########## 圣 spool primitive
圣	holy, sacred					spool	Here we see a simplified drawing of a <b>spool</b> (the element for earth at the bottom) with threads being wound about it tightly (the crotch at the top). You may remember it either pictographically or by way of the primitives. [5]		又土
茎	stalk, stem		艹圣	stalk	stalk		Flower ... <i>spool</i>. [8]		土又⺾


######## miscellanous
地	ground, earth		土也	ground	ground		<i>Soil</i> and a <i>scorpion</i> (an “earth animal”). This is, of course, the full character from which the primitive for <b>ground</b> derives. [6]		土也
干	dry, parch, ebb, recede, interfere, intercede		干	dry	dry		It is best to see this kanji as a pictograph of a revolving circular clothesline (viewed from the side). Spin it around quickly in your mind's eye to give it the connotation of to <b>dry</b>.	The primitive meaning is <i>clothesline</i>. Editor's note: Be careful when making a distinction to <i>potato (于)</i>. The only difference in the latter is a small hook at the end of the 3rd stroke.	干十一
面	mask, face, features, surface		目百	mask	mask		Imagine a <b>mask</b> over your head with <i>eyes</i> peeping out from all over the head, a <i>hundred</i> in all (the element for <i>eye</i> displacing the fifth stroke of that for <i>hundred</i>).		面
久	long time, old story		勹人	long time	long time		This character uses the diagonal sweep of the second stroke to double up for <i>bound up</i> and a <i>person</i>. Think of a mummy, and the key word will not be far behind.		ノ入久
匕	spoon, spoon or katakana hi radical (no. 21)		匕	spoon	spoon	sitting on the ground	This character, a pictograph of a <b>spoon</b>, is easy enough to remember, provided you keep it distinct from that for <i>seven</i>, where the first stroke is written left to right (the opposite of here) and cuts noticeably across the second.	As a primitive, this kanji can take on the additional meaning of someone <i>sitting on the ground</i>, of which it can also be considered a pictograph. In general, the second stroke does not cut through the first - or if it does in some fonts, only slightly.	匕
𠦝			十早			mist	Here is our second example of a primitive composed of other primitives but not itself a kanji. At the bottom is the primitive (also a kanji) for <i>early</i> or <i>sunflower</i>. At the top, a <i>needle</i>. Conveniently, <b>mist</b> falls <i>early</i> in the morning, like little <i>needle</i>s of rain, to assure that the <i>sunflower</i> blooms <i>early</i> as we have learned it should. [8]		十日
昨	yesterday, previous		日乍	yesterday	yesterday		<i>Day</i> ... <i>saw</i>. [9]		｜ノ日
康	ease, peace		广隶	sane	sane		<i>Cave</i> ... <i>sieve</i>. [11]		ヨ水广隶
柿	persimmon		木市	persimmon	persimmon		Imagine a village <i>market</i> with stalls set up around an immense <b>persimmon</b> <i>tree</i> with watermelon-sized fruit. If it weren't for the fact that the <i>tree</i> is sacred to the village, people would get impatient as the <b>persimmons</b> fall from the <i>tree</i> and wreak havoc on buyers and sellers alike.		｜巾木亠冂
夭	early death, calamity					witch		Pay special attention to the fact that here the first stroke is written right to left, rather like the first stroke of thousand (FRAME 40), rather than left to right (天 heavens)	ノ大
見	see, hopes, chances, idea, opinion, look at, visible		目儿	see	see		The elements that compose the character for <b>see</b> are the <i>eye</i> firmly fixed to a pair of <i>human legs</i>. Surely, somewhere in your experience, there is a vivid image just waiting to be dragged up to help you remember this character....		見目儿
殳	pike, windy-again radical (no. 79)		几又			lance, missile	Although modern connotations are more suggestive, this primitive simply refers to something thrown as a weapon. Itselements: <i>wind</i> ... <i>crotch</i>. [4]		殳几又
㕣	a marsh at the foot of the hills, name of a river		入八口			gully	As an abbreviation of the kanji for a valley, this primitive gets its meaning as a small valley or <b>gully</b>. [5]		ハ口
竟	end, finally		音立日儿			mirror	This primitive gets its meaning from the following frame. It shows a pair of <i>human legs</i> and a <i>tongue-wagging mouth</i> looking at a <b>mirror</b> <i>standing</i> on the wall, asking perhaps who might be the fairest of them all. [11]		音日立儿
革	leather, skin, reform, become serious		艹車廿口十	leather	leather		After the <i>flowers</i> at the top (painted on the <b>leather</b> for decoration), we see the element for <i>car</i> with the middle stroke left out. Think of the seats having been taken out so that they can be reupholstered with this decorated <b>leather</b>.		革廾口十

# 麺 noodles: fix primitive 麥 -> 麦
麺	noodles, wheat flour		麦面	noodles	noodles		<i>Barley</i> . . . <i>mask</i>.		麦面夂


### Add primitives
皮	pelt, skin, hide, leather, skin radical (no. 107)		支	pelt	pelt		The simplest way to remember this character is to see it as built up from that for <i>branch</i>. The first stroke can then stand for something "hanging" down from the <i>branch</i>, namely its bark or <b>pelt</b>. The barb at the end of the second stroke is the only other change. Merely by concentrating on this as you write the following small cluster of characters should be enough to fix the form in your mind. By way of exception, you might doodle around with the kanji's form to see what you can come up with.		皮又
樋	water pipe, gutter, downspout, conduit		木通	downspout	downspout				辶木用マ
蝦	shrimp, prawn, lobster		虫又口	shrimp	shrimp				虫又口
杷	kind of rake, loquat		木巴	grain rake	grain rake				木巴
粁	kilometer, (kokuji)		米千	kilometer	kilometer				干米十千
粍	millimeter, (kokuji)		米毛	millimeter	millimeter				米毛
淵	abyss, edge, deep pool, the depths		水片	abyss (old)	abyss (old)				｜一氵
舟	boat, ship		丶冂	boat	boat		After the <i>drop</i> and the <i>glass canopy</i>, we come to a combination of three strokes that we met only once before, in the character for <i>mama</i> (frame 105). The pictographic meaning we gave it there has no etymological relationship to this character, but use it if it helps.		舟


### Add missing primitive keywords
心	heart, mind, spirit, heart radical (no. 61)	忄⺗	心	heart	heart	state of mind, valentine	This character, a pictographic representation of the <b>heart</b>, is among the most widely used primitives we shall meet.	As a primitive, it can take three forms, to which we shall assign three distinct meanings. In its kanji-form, it appears BENEATH or to the RIGHT of its relative primitive and means the physical organ of the <i>heart</i>.<br/> To the LEFT, it is abbreviated to three strokes, ⺖,  and means a wildly emotional <i>state of mind</i>. And finally, at the very BOTTOM, it can take the form ⺗, in which case we give it the meaning of a <i>valentine</i>.	
言	say, word		言	say	say	saying, speech, words	Of all the things we can do with our <i>mouths</i>, <b>speech</b> is the one that requires the greatest distinctness and clarity. Hence the kanji for <b>say</b> has four little sound-waves, indicating the complexity of the achievement.	This kanji, which appears often as a primitive, can mean <i>saying</i>, <i>speech</i>, or <i>words</i>, depending on which is most useful.	言
日	day, sun, Japan, counter for days		日	day	day	sun, tongue wagging in the mouth	This kanji is intended to be a pictograph of the <i>sun</i>. Recalling what we said in the previous frame about round forms, it is easy to detect the circle and the big smile that characterize our simplest drawings of the <b>sun</b> - like those yellow badges with the words, "Have a nice <b>day</b>!"	Used as a primitive, this kanji can mean <i>sun</i> or <i>day</i> or a <i>tongue wagging in the mouth</i>. This latter meaning, incidentally, derives from an old character outside the standard list meaning something like "sayeth" and written almost exactly the same, except that the stroke in the middle does not touch the right side (Frame 620).	日
肉	meat	月	肉	meat	meat	flesh, part of the body 	Let this doubling of one of the elements for "<i>inside</i>" yield the sense of "<i>insides</i>" to approach the key word, <b>meat</b>. The abbreviated form of this character gave us the primitive meaning of <i>flesh</i> or <i>part of the body</i> for the kanji 月.		肉冂人
丁	street, ward, town, counter for guns, tools, leaves or cakes of something, even number, 4th calendar sign		丁	street	street	nail, spike	The picture here is of a <b>street</b> sign on a long pole: Hollywood and Vine, if you please, or any <i>street</i> that immediately conjure sup the image of a <b>street</b> sign to you.	Used as a primitive, we change the meaning of the key word and take the shape to signify a <i>nail</i> or a <i>spike</i>. Should it happen, on reviewing, that you find the pictographs get jumbled, then think of jerking a <i>street</i> sign out of the ground and using it as a <i>nail</i> to repair your garage roof.	一亅
刀	sword, saber, knife	刂	刀	sword	sword	dagger, saber	Although this character no longer looks very much like a <b>sword</b>, it does have some resemblance to the handle of the <b>sword</b>. This is to our advantage, in that it helps us keep make a distinction between two primitive elements based on this kanji.	In the form of the kanji, this primitive means a <i>dagger</i>. When it appears to the right of another element, it is commonly stretched out and takes the sense of a great and flashing <i>saber</i>, a meaning it gets from a character we shall learn later (Frame 1801).	刀
欠	lack, gap, fail, yawning radical (no. 76)		欠	lack	lack	yawn	The pictograph hidden in this character is of someone <i>yawn</i>ing. The first stroke shows the head thrown back; the second, the arm bent at the elbow as the hand reaches up to cover the mouth; and the last two, the legs. Since <b>yawn</b>ing shows a <b>lack</b> of something (psychologically, interest; physiologically, sleep), the connection is plain to see.	As a primitive, it can mean either <i>yawn</i> or <i>lack</i>.	欠勹人
火	fire	灬	火	fire	fire	fireplace, cauldron, oven fire	Just as sitting before a <b>fire</b> enlivens the imagination and lets you see almost anything you want to in the flames, this kanji is so simple it lets you see almost any sort of <b>fire</b> you want to see. It no longer makes a good pictograph, but I invite you to take a pencil and paper and play with the form - first writing it as shown below and then adding lines here and there - to see what you can come up with. Everything from matchbooks to cigarette lighters to volcanic eruptions to the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah have been found here. No doubt you, too, will find something interesting to bend your memory around these four simple strokes.	To avoid confusion later on, it is best to keep to the meaning of a <i>fireplace</i> (or <i>hearth</i>) or a raging <i>conflagration</i> like a forest fire for this kanji's primitive meaning. Another primitive element for <i>fire</i>, based on this one, is written 灬 and will mean <i>flames</i>, <i>cauldron</i>, <i>cooking fire</i>, or an <i>oven fire</i>.	火
酉	west, bird, sign of the bird, 5-7PM, tenth sign of Chinese zodiac, sake radical (no. 164)		西一	sign of the bird	sign of the bird	alcohol, whiskey bottle	Though we shall later encounter the kanji for <i>bird</i>, we introduce this <i>one</i> for the tenth sign of the zodiac mainly because of its use as a primitive, where it has a different meaning.	As a primitive, it means <i>whiskey bottle</i>. In its pictograph, you can see the loosely corked lid, the bottle and the contents (about <i>one</i>-third full). You might also think of the Spanish "porrón," a decanter shaped like a long-necked bird.	酉

########## 艹 flowers primitive. 
### Switch from using 艸 alternative primitive. Also remove 'salad' from the list of primitive alternatives
艹	grass, grass radical (no. 140)	艸				flowers	We are not yet equipped with all the pieces necessary to learn the character for μower, so shall have to content ourselves here with the first three strokes 艹, which represent the primitive of the same meaning. Concentrate on the actual “bloom” of the μower, and keep a particular μower in mind. Try a rose, a tulip, or a daisy, since none of them will have their own kanji. [3]		⺾屮
落	fall, drop, come down, village, hamlet		艹水各	fall	fall		When <i>water</i> <b>falls</b>, it splats and splashes; when <i>flower</i> petals <b>fall</b>, they float gently in the breeze. To <i>each</i> thing its own way of <b>falling</b>.		口氵夂⺾
備	equip, provision, preparation		人艹厂用	equip	equip		<i>Person</i> . . . <i>flowers</i> . . . <i>cliff</i> . . . <i>screwdriver</i>. In cases like this you can jumble up the primitive into any order that seems best for the composition of a story, provided you feel confident about the relative position that those primitives take to one another in the completed character.		⺅用厂⺾
葉	leaf, plane, lobe, needle, blade, spear, counter for flat things, fragment, piece		艹世木	leaf	leaf		Three elements are given here: <i>flower</i> . . . <i>generation</i> . . . <i>tree</i>. The first and last seem logical enough, since it is the <b>leaf</b> that feeds the <i>flowers</i> on a <i>tree</i>. The element for <i>generation</i> interposed between the two suggests that the movement of a <i>tree</i> from one <i>generation</i> to the next is like its "turning over a new <b>leaf</b>."		木世⺾
護	safeguard, protect		言艹隻	safeguard	safeguard		<i>Words</i> . . . <i>flowers</i> . . . <i>vessels</i>.		言又⺾隹
苦	suffering, trial, worry, hardship, feel bitter, scowl		艹古	suffering	suffering		The picture of <b>suffering</b> we are given here is that of a <i>flower</i> that has grown <i>old</i>. When a <i>flower</i> ages, it pales and dries up, and probably even <b>suffers</b>. If you think that plants are incapable of such feelings, then ask yourself why so many people believe that talking to their <i>flowers</i> helps them bloom better.		口十⺾
花	flower		艹化	flower	flower		<b>Flower</b> . . . <i>change</i>.		⺅匕⺾
薬	medicine, chemical, enamel, gunpowder, benefit		艹楽	medicine	medicine		<i>Flowers</i> . . . <i>music</i>.		日木冫⺾
満	full, fullness, enough, satisfy		水艹両	full	full		<i>Water</i> . . . <i>flowers</i> . . . <i>both</i>. Given the abstract nature of this last primitive, you may want to borrow the image from the previous frame.		｜一氵二冂山
若	young, if, perhaps, possibly, low number, immature		艹右	young	young		Here we see a flower held in the <i>right</i> hand. You can imagine yourself in a magic garden where <i>flowers</i> picked with the <i>right</i> hand grant eternal youth; and those picked with the left, premature senility. Go ahead, pick one with each hand and watch what happens. [8]		ノ一口⺾
英	England, English, hero, outstanding, calyx		艹央	England	England		<i>Flowers</i> . . . <i>center</i>. This is another abbreviation used to identify a country by the pronunciation of the kanji.		ノ⺾大
菜	vegetable, side dish, greens		艹采	vegetable	vegetable		Flower . . . <i>grab</i>.		爪木⺾
荷	baggage, shoulder-pole load, bear (a burden), shoulder (a gun), load, cargo, freight		艹何	baggage	baggage		<i>Flowers</i> . . . <i>what</i>.		⺅口亅⺾一
芸	technique, art, craft, performance, acting, trick, stunt		艹云	technique	technique		The secret <b>technique</b> of making a <i>rising cloud</i> of smoke turn into a bouquet of <i>flowers</i> is shown here.		二厶⺾
草	grass, weeds, herbs, pasture, write, draft		艹早	grass	grass		Perhaps you know the custom of seeding <b>grass</b> randomly or in some particular pattern with the <i>flower</i> called the crocus, which blooms for a few days each year in <i>early</i> spring. As the <b>grass</b> begins to turn green again after winter has passed, these tiny <i>flowers</i> dot up here and there. Now just look out your window at a patch of <b>grass</b> somewhere and think what a nice idea it would be to have your name spelled out in <i>flowers</i> once as a sort of <i>early</i> harbinger of spring.		十日⺾
蔵	storehouse, hide, own, have, possess		艹臣戊	storehouse	storehouse		<i>Flowers</i> . . . <i>parade</i> . . . <i>slave</i>s.		ノ臣戈⺾
猫	cat		犬艹田	cat	cat		Knowing how much <i>dog</i>s love to chase <b>cats</b>, picture a <i>pack of wild dogs</i> planting "<b>cat</b>-<i>seedlings</i>," watering them, and fertilizing them until they can be harvested as a crop of <b>cats</b> for them to chase and torment. If you begin from the key word and think of a "crop of <b>cats</b>," you will not confuse this story with the apparently similar story of two frames ago.		田犭⺾
敬	awe, respect, honor, revere		艹句攵	awe	awe		Standing in <b>awe</b> of someone, you get self-conscious and may try to speak in <i>flowery phrases</i> out of veneration or fear. The <i>taskmaster</i> at the right is drilling you in the practice of your "honorifics."		口勹攵⺾
獲	seize, get, find, earn, acquire, can, may, able to		犬艹隻	seize	seize		A pack of <i>wild dogs</i> . . . <i>flowers</i> . . . <i>vessels</i>. Do not confuse this with the character for <i>arrest</i> (Frame 706).		犭又⺾隹
葬	interment, bury, shelve		艹死廾	interment	interment		<i>Flowers</i> . . . <i>death</i> . . . <i>two hands</i>. Do not confuse with <i>bury</i> (Frame 191).		一夕匕廾⺾
菓	candy, cakes, fruit		艹果	candy	confectionary		<i>Flowers</i> . . . <i>fruit</i>s.		田木⺾
芝	turf, lawn		艹之	turf	turf		<i>Flowers</i> . . . <i>building blocks</i>.		亠⺾
菊	chrysanthemum		艹勹米	chrysanthemum	chrysanthemum		Flower . . . <i>bound up</i> . . . <i>rice</i>.		米勹⺾
芽	bud, sprout, spear, germ		艹牙	bud	bud		<i>Flowers</i> . . . <i>tusk</i>.		牙⺾
蓮	lotus		艹連	lotus	lotus				辶車⺾
菌	germ, fungus, bacteria		艹囗禾	germ	germ		<i>Flowers</i> . . . <i>pent in</i> . . . <i>wheat</i>.		禾囗⺾
薫	send forth fragrance, fragrant, be scented, smoke (tobacco)		艹重火	fragrant	fragrant		<i>Flowers</i> . . . <i>heavy</i> . . . <i>oven fire</i>. Do not confuse with <i>incense</i> (Frame 977) or <i>perfumed</i> (Frame 532).		｜灬⺾日ノ一
塔	pagoda, tower, steeple		土艹合	pagoda	pagoda		On the left we see a mound of <i>dirt</i>, and to the right <i>flowers</i> made to <i>fit</i> together. The two sides combine to create a great <b>pagoda</b> made of <i>dirt</i>, with <i>flowers</i> by the tens of thousands <i>fitted</i> together for the roofing of each of the layers. Be sure to put yourself in the scene and <i>fit</i> a few of the <i>flowers</i> in place yourself so that the image works its way into memory with full force.		口土𠆢⺾
著	renowned, publish, write, remarkable, phenomenal, put on, don, wear, arrival, finish (race), counter for suits of clothing, literary work		艹者	renowned	renowned		<i>Flowers</i> . . . <i>puppet</i>.		日⺹⺾
寛	tolerant, leniency, generosity, relax, feel at home, be at ease, broadminded		宀艹見	tolerant	tolerant		The <i>house</i> of <i>flowers</i> or "hot<i>house</i>" has become a metaphor for a narrow-minded, biased, and in<b>tolerant</b> attitude distrustful of change. <b>Tolerance</b>, in contrast, is open-minded and welcomes novelty. The way to encourage <b>tolerance</b> in those who lack it is first to have them <i>see</i> through their own hot<i>house</i> attitudes, which is the very counsel we are given in this kanji.		見宀⺾
荘	villa, inn, cottage, feudal manor, solemn, dignified		艹壮	villa	villa		The <b>villa</b> pictured here is filled with exotic <i>flowers</i> at every turn, and has a pair of <i>turtle-samurai</i> standing before its gates.		士爿⺾
蘭	orchid, Holland		艹闌	orchid	orchid				｜一日木門⺾
穫	harvest, reap		禾艹隻	harvest	harvest		<i>Wheat</i> . . . <i>flowers</i> . . . <i>vessels</i>. Compare frames 756 and 757 for the right side.		禾又⺾隹
苗	seedling, sapling, shoot		艹田	seedling	seedling		To avoid confusion with the image of rice <b>seedling</b>s to appear later, we shall take these <b>seedlings</b> out of their agricultural setting in the <i>rice fields</i> and into the frame of Brave New World surgery, where "ideas" or "values" are being implanted into <i>brains</i> like <b>seedlings</b> to insure a harmonious society. Then you need only imagine them taking root and breaking out into <i>flower</i> right through the tops of the skulls of people walking around on the streets.		田⺾
萌	show symptoms of, sprout, bud, malt		艹明	germinate	germinate				月日⺾
蘇	be resuscitated, revived, perilla, shiso		艹魚禾	resurrect	resurrect				禾魚田灬⺾
芳	perfume, balmy, favorable, fragrant		艹方	perfumed	perfumed		Here we see a special <i>compass</i> used to pick out those <i>flowers</i> most suited for making good <b>perfumes</b>.		方⺾

蔽	cover, shade, mantle, capsize, be ruined		艹敝	cover over	cover over		Flower . . . <i>shredder</i>.		｜巾⺌并冂攵⺾
繭	cocoon		艹冂糸虫	cocoon	cocoon		Though it's a good thing that the primitive for <b>cocoon</b> has been radically abbreviated from this, its full form as a kanji, the story it holds is a charming one. The silkworm (<i>insect</i>) eats the leaves of the mulberry bush (the <i>flowers</i>), digests them and transforms them into <i>thread</i> with which it spins about itself, in mystic wisdom, its own coffin (the <i>hood</i>). The dividing line that separates the two elements helps the picture of the little worm cutting itself off from contact with the outside world, but as a character stroke, it is a clear exception.		糸幺小虫風冂⺾
蒔	sow (seeds)		艹時	sowing	sowing				寸土日⺾
蒲	bullrush, flag, cattail		艹浦	bullrush	bullrush		<i>Flowers</i> . . . <i>bay</i>.		氵用丶⺾十

藩	clan, enclosure		艹水番	clan	clan		<i>Flowers</i> . . . <i>water</i> . . . <i>dice</i>.		氵田釆米⺾
苛	torment, scold, chastise		艹可	bullying	bullying		A nosegay of <i>flowers</i> make a nice gift, but if those <i>flowers</i> are poison oak, they <i>can</i> amount to <b>bullying</b>. Be sure to emphasize the word <i>can</i> when you repeat this little phrase to yourself.		一口亅⺾
荻	reed, rush		艹犬火	reed	reed		You've no doubt seen cattails, those swamp <b>reeds</b> with a furry <i>flower</i> to them like the tail of a cat. This might just turn out to be a good way to get rid of a troublesome <i>pack of wild dogs</i>: lure them into a swamp of these <b>reeds</b> with the cattail <i>flowers</i> and then set <i>fire</i> to the swamp. Take care to focus on the <i>flower</i> rather than the "cattail" to avoid confusion with frame 259 below.		火犭⺾
萎	wither, droop, lame		艹委	numb	numb		<i>Flowers</i> . . . <i>committee</i>.		禾女⺾
茨	briar, thorn		艹次	briar	briar		Earlier we made mention of the story of <b>Briar</b> Rose (or "Sleeping Beauty," as we called her in frame 165) and drew attention to the <b>briar</b> hedge that grew up all about her castle. But in the <i>second</i> part of the story, these <b>briars</b> blossomed into <i>flowers</i>. Hence her name, <b>Briar</b> Rose. Be careful not to confuse this character with that for <i>thorn</i> (Frame 446).		欠冫⺾
菱	diamond (shape), water chestnut, rhombus		艹圥夂	diamond	diamond		Named after a <b>diamond</b>-shaped flower (the water caltrop), this key word refers to things shaped like a <b>diamond</b>. Its elements: <i>flower</i> . . . <i>rice seedlings</i> . . . <i>walking legs</i>.		土儿夂⺾
蔦	vine, ivy		艹鳥	vine	vine		Flower . . . <i>bird</i>.		鳥灬⺾

# This is not the form of 'flowers' primitive that Heisig uses, even though it is semantically the same radical
