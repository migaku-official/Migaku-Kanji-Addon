無	nothingness, none, ain't, nothing, nil, not		𠂉[oaken_tub]灬	nothingness	nothingness		This character is the Japanese character for the supreme philosophical principle of much Oriental thought: <b>nothingness</b>. Make use of the oaken <i>tub</i> from the previous frame, and add to that the <i>oven fire</i> at the bottom.		｜ノ一灬無
舞	dance, flit, circle, wheel		𠂉[oaken_tub]舛	dance	dance		The top two strokes show someone <i>reclining</i>, and the next six are a pictograph of an oaken <i>tub</i> ribbed with metal strips, like the kind once used for bathing. At the bottom, the <i>sunglasses</i> round off the character.		｜ノ一舛二夕無
[banner]	banner		方𠂉	banner	banner		Here we have a unique enclosure made up of two elements: compass and reclining. Think of the banner as a standard for rallying around; then imagine a crowd reclining before a compass (presumably to give them a "direction" in life). [6]		ノ方一
施	give, bestow, perform, alms		[banner]也	alms	alms		banner Banner . . . scorpion		ノ方一也
族	tribe, family		[banner]矢	tribe	tribe		Banner . . . dart.		方矢
旅	trip, travel		[banner]衣	trip	trip		Let the last 4 strokes, which are also the concluding strokes to the character for <i>garment</i>, represent a <i>rag</i> as its primitive meaning. We shall meet this only on one other occasion. This gives us as our elements: <i>banner</i> . . . <i>rag</i>.		ノ方一
[top_hat_and_scarf]	top hat and scarf		亠𧘇	top hat and scarf	top hat and scarf		HeisigStoryPlaceHolder		
𧘇	scarf		𧘇	scarf	scarf	clothes, scarf	HeisigStoryPlaceHolder		
衣	garment, clothes, dressing		衣[top_hat_and_scarf]	garment	garment		At the top we see the <i>top hat</i>, and at the bottom a pictographic representation of the folds of a <b>garment</b>. If you break the "4-fold" fold into 2 sets of 2 strokes, you will find it easier to remember.	Used as a primitive, the additional meanings of <i>cloak</i> or <i>scarf</i> will come in handy. What has to be noted particularly are the changes in shape the kanji can undergo when it becomes an element in other kanji. In fact, it is the most volatile of all the kanji we shall treat, and for that reason deserves special attention here. When it appears to the left, it looks like a hiragana ne (ネ) with an extra drop on the right, and we shall take it to mean <i>cloak</i>. At the bottom, when attached to the stroke immediately above it, the first two strokes (the <i>top hat</i>) are omitted, which we shall take to mean a <i>scarf</i>. On rare occasions, the element can be torn right across the middle, with the first 2 strokes appearing at the top and the last 4 at the bottom of another primitive or cluster of primitive, in which cases we shall speak of a <i>top hat and scarf</i>. And finally, of course, it can keep its original kanji shape, along with its original meaning of <i>garment</i> in general. Note that when any of the above forms have something beneath them (as in frame 429), the third from final stroke is "unhooked."	衣亠
裏	back, amidst, in, reverse, inside, palm, sole, rear, lining, wrong side		[top_hat_and_scarf]里	back	back		An innocent looking <i>top hat and scarf</i> lying there in front of you, turned over, reveal a hidden <i>computer</i> sewn into the <b>back</b> of each - obviously the tools of a master spy. Such experiences teach one always to have a look at the <b>back</b> side of things.		衣里亠
衰	decline, wane, weaken		[top_hat_and_scarf]口一	decline	decline		Let this key word connote the <b>decline</b> and fall of the Roman Empire. It shows a fellow in a <i>top hat</i> and <i>scarf</i>, trying hard to look happy by putting a <i>walking stick</i> in his <i>mouth</i> sideways to twist his face into a grotesque but semi permanent smile.		衣一亠
褒	praise, extol		[top_hat_and_scarf]保	praise	praise		<i>Top hat and scarf</i> . . . <i>protect</i>. Note that the "tree" in <i>protect</i> becomes a <i>wooden pole</i> here.		衣⺅口小亠
哀	pathetic, grief, sorrow, pathos, pity, sympathize		[top_hat_and_scarf]口	pathetic	pathetic		A drunken sod in a tattered <i>top hat</i> and soiled silk <i>scarf</i> with a giant <i>mouth</i> guzzling something or other gives us a <b>pathetic</b> character role in which W. C. Fields might find himself right at home.		衣口亠
衷	inmost, heart, mind, inside		[top_hat_and_scarf]口丨	inmost	inmost		Between the <i>top hat</i> and the <i>scarf</i> you will see the character for <i>in</i> which is truncated at the bottom so as not to interfere with the <i>scarf</i>. You can think of this character forming as a pair with that of the former frame: there the <i>in</i> (the <i>walking stick</i> in the <i>mouth</i>) was set on its side; here it is set upright.		衣十口
