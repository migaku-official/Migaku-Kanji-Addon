#####  丌 is not a table
丌	table								一｜ノ

# remove reference to 丌
具	tool, utensil, means, possess, ingredients, counter for armor, suits, sets of furniture		目[tool]	tool	tool		Here is the full kanji on which the last frame is based. If you can think of a table full of carpenter's <b>tools</b> of all sorts, each equipped with its own <i>eye</i> so that it can keep a watch over what you are doing with it, you won't have trouble later keeping the primitive and the kanji apart.		一ハ目
興	entertain, revive, retrieve, interest, pleasure		臼同[tool]	entertain	entertain		<i>Mortar</i> . . . <i>same</i> . . . <i>tool</i>. Be careful to make an image that keeps <i>same</i> in the middle.		臼口ハ冂一

# use 儿 like Heisig wanted instead of the very rare 兀 kanji
光	ray, light		小儿	ray	ray		There are really only 2 primitives here, <i>little</i> and <i>human legs</i>. The 4th stroke that separates them is added for reasons of aesthetics. (If that doesn't make sense, try writing the kanji without it and see how ugly the results look, even to your beginner's eye.) Now if you have wondered what those little particles of "dust" are that dance around in the light-<b>rays</b> that come through the window and fall on your desk, try imagining them as <i>little</i> and disembodied <i>human legs</i>, and you should have no trouble with this character.		一⺌儿

# Add 'fit' primitive as Heisig intended. Also, person is not a umbrella. Add 'meeting' primitive
命	fate, command, decree, destiny, life, appoint		合亼口卩	fate	fate		This character connotes life in general, but also the particular life that is <b>fated</b> one by virtue of the distinctive character with which one is born. Its elements are: <i>fit</i> . . . <i>stamp</i>. The bottom portion of <i>fit</i> is nudged to the left in order to make room for the <i>stamp</i>.		口𠆢卩一

# Use 'wealth' primitive
富	wealth, enrich, abundant		宀畐	wealth	wealth		Here we have the original character on which the primitive element for <b>wealth</b> is based. In keeping with the story introduced back then, note how all the <b>wealth</b> is kept under the roof of the same <i>house</i>.		口田宀

########### 𦰩 'scarecrow'
# Scarecrow actually has a kanji so no [scarecrow] .svg needed
𦰩			艹口夫			scarecrow	By twisting the final two strokes of our cabbage into a pair of legs (it's actually <i>husband</i>), we get a <b>scarecrow</b> with a cabbage for a head. [10]		
嘆	sigh, lament, moan, grieve, sigh of admiration		口𦰩	sigh	sigh		<i>Mouth</i> . . . <i>scarecrow</i>.		ノ一口⺾
難	difficult, impossible, trouble, accident, defect		𦰩隹	difficult	difficult		<i>Scarecrow</i> . . . <i>turkey</i>.		⺾隹大口亠
漢	Sino-, China		水𦰩	Sino-	Sino-		<i>Water</i> ... <i>scarecrow</i>. The key word has come to refer to things Chinese in general, including the kanji themselves (for which this character is used). [13]		氵⺾口一大

# use 艹 instead of  艸
薄	dilute, thin, weak (tea), pampas grass		艹水尃	dilute	dilute		Take a good look at this kanji: the "strong" element here is really the <i>flower</i>, not the <i>water</i> as you might have thought on first glance. To the right is the <i>acupuncturist</i> from frame 48. Taking the key word to connote <b>diluting</b> the vital humors of the body, we can imagine our <i>acupuncturist</i> performing his task with <i>flowers</i> in place of needles, and using their hollow stems to pipe <i>water</i> into the body of the patient.		十氵寸田丶⺾


###### add primitives
諜	spy out, reconnoiter		言世木	secret agent	secret agent				言木世
牒	label, genealogy, circular		片世木	label	label				片木世
卉	grass		十			haystack	The three <i>needles</i> stacked up give us a <b>haystack</b> (in which it may be harder to find the hay than the needles). In the rare case in which there is nothing underneath this element, as in the following frame, the last three strokes are written virtually the same as two hands—that is, the second stroke sweeps down slightly to the left. [5]		十廾
尭	high, far		卉儿	lofty		straw man	The two <i>human legs</i> added to the <i>haystack</i> (with the horizontal stroke to keep the two parts distinct from one another and avoid an ugly tangle) give us a <b>straw man</b>. [8]		十儿廾一
戈	halberd, arms, festival car, float, tasselled spear radical (no. 62)		弋			pike, fiesta	The picture in this primitive is what we may call a “tassled arrow.” A decorative tassle is strung on the shaft of an arrow to indicate that it is no longer a weapon but a symbol of a <b>fiesta</b>. As before, the first stroke is extended when it serves as a semi-enclosure. [4]		戈
圣	holy, sacred		又土			spool	Here we see a simplified drawing of a <b>spool</b> (the element for earth at the bottom) with threads being wound about it tightly (the crotch at the top). You may remember it either pictographically or by way of the primitives. [5]		又土
圥	mushroom		土儿			rice seedlings	As we mentioned back in frame 234, <b>rice seedlings</b> get an element all their own: soil and man legs becomes an ideograph of the spikelets of rice bunched together for implanting in the muddy soil of the paddy. [5]		儿土
复	return, repeat, repeatedly		𠂉日夂			double back	Either the idea of turning around and heading back during one’s travels, or of folding an object in half will do. The kanji depicts someone <b>doubling back</b> to the nearest inn to <i>lie down</i> and rest a weary pair of <i>walking legs</i> after a full <i>day’s</i> voyage. [9]		一ノ夂日
[purse]			中一			purse	By adding a single stroke at the bottom of the kanji for in, we get a sort of pictograph of a <b>purse</b>. [5]		中一
[staple_gun]			[staples]			staple gun	The familiar primitive for staples with an additional stroke cutting through the vertical stroke. It is easiest in these cases to make a primitive related to what we already know. Hence, we call it a <b>staple gun</b>.		
豕	pig, hog, pig radical (no. 152)		[piglets]			sow	Let this primitive represent a fat <b>sow</b>. Easier than pulling it apart into smaller elements is remembering its shape as a highly stylized pictograph. Practice its 7 strokes a few times before going on to examples of its use in the next six frames. [7]		豕
[wall]			一厶			wall	The elbow hanging under a ceiling will become our element for a <b>wall</b>. [3]		
[pegasus]			午隹			pegasus	By combining the horse (giving a twist to its final stroke a bit to the left to keep the strokes from overlapping) with the turkey, we get a flying horse or <b>Pegasus</b>. Be sure not to confuse with the turkey house 隺 from frame 567. [11]		
方	direction, person, alternative		亠刀	direction	direction	compass	Spinning a <i>dagger</i> about on its hilt on the top of a <i>top hat</i> - waiting to see in which <b>direction</b> it points when it comes to rest - one leaves to fate where one is going next. Take care in writing this character.	As a primitive, this character will take the sense of a <i>compass</i>, the instrument used to determine <i>direction</i>.	方
歹	bare bone, bad, wrong, death radical (n. 78)		一夕			bones	This character is meant to be a pictograph of a <b>bone</b> attached to a piece of flesh (or vice versa.) The first stroke serves to keep it distinct from the character for <i>evening</i> (frame 109). [4]		歹
[piglets]		一勿				piglets	This abbreviation of the full primitive for a sow, quite naturally, means <b>piglets</b>. [5]	Editor's note: Combination of a pictograph and mnemonics: Row of <b>piglets</b>, <i>one</i> of which (the rightmost) has its tail curved, almost as if it's been tied to a "knot" (勿 not)	

# add 倣 emulate primitive
傲	be proud		人土方攵倣	arrogance	arrogance		<i>Person</i> . . . <i>soil</i> . . . <i>compass</i> . . . <i>taskmaster</i>. You may, of course, take the character for <i>emulate</i> from the previous frame as the basis for this kanji, adding to it only the element for <i>soil</i>.		⺅土方攵


# snare is NOT a slingshot !
丂	obstruction of breath (qi) as it seeks release, variant of other characters					snare	The simple <b>snare</b> composed of a piece of vine and a bent twig is depicted here as a sort of abbreviation of the bow, to which it is related. [2]		一勹
# add snare reference for comparison
[slingshot]						slingshot	The <b>slingshot</b> differs from the snare (丂) by virtue of the first stroke, which you may take as the strip of rubber you pull back on, to make the <b>slingshot</b> sling. [2]		

# add 'half' reference for comparison
[quarter]						quarter	This character simply splits the vertical stroke of a half (半) in half once again, to get a <b>quarter</b>. In so doing, it spreads the split stroke out to form a sort of enclosure under which its main relative primitive will be placed. It can be used either in its substantive or verbal meaning. [6]		


######## Add primitive references from RK3: New kanji from old primitives
# 采 'grab' primitive. 
彩	coloring, paint, makeup		爪木采彡	coloring	coloring		Vulture . . . tree . . . shape.		爪木彡

# 或 'a certain' primitive
或	some, one, or, possibly, a certain		戈口一或	a  (a certain)	a  (a certain)				口戈一
域	range, region, limits, stage, level		土戈口一或	range	range		From its original meaning of a defined area or z<i>one</i>, a <b>range</b> has also come to mean a grazing <i>land</i> where cowboys roam and do whatever it is they do with cows. When the herds have all been driven to market, there is a great homecoming <i>fiesta</i> like that pictured here. As soon as the cowboys come home, home on the <b>range</b>, the first thing they do is kiss the ground (the <i>mouth</i> on the <i>floor</i>), and then get on with the <i>fiesta</i>. [11]		口土戈
惑	beguile, delusion, perplexity		戈口一或心	beguile	beguile		The first three elements, <i>fiesta</i> . . . <i>mouth</i> . . . <i>floor</i>, appeared together once already in frame 380. Beneath them, once again, the <i>heart</i>.		口心戈

# 韭 'green onion' primitive
韭	leek radical (no. 179)		非一			green onion	un- ... floor. [9]		韭

# fix typos in Heisig story
艹	grass, grass radical (no. 140)	艸				flowers	We are not yet equipped with all the pieces necessary to learn the character for flower, so shall have to content ourselves here with the first three strokes 艹, which represent the primitive of the same meaning. Concentrate on the actual “bloom” of the flower, and keep a particular flower in mind. Try a rose, a tulip, or a daisy, since none of them will have their own kanji. [3]		⺾屮

# fix story
模	imitation, copy, mock		木莫	imitation	imitation		Ah, but haven’t modern graveyards become a parody of their ancestors! The flowers are plastic, the writing on the stones is unimaginative and cold, and the whole thing looks more like a marble orchard than a right and proper graveyard. This kanji continues with the modernization trend by picturing imitation trees in the graveyard. But of course, how convenient! They don’t need pruning or fertilizing, their leaves don’t fall, and they remain the same color all year long. [14]		大日木⺾

####### fix primitives
刖	cutting off feet as form of punishment		月刀			butcher	We see the elements for flesh and saber, which combine to create a compound element for a <b>butcher</b> and his trade		刂月
無	nothingness, none, ain't, nothing, nil, not		𠂉[oaken_tub]火	nothingness	nothingness		This character is the Japanese character for the supreme philosophical principle of much Oriental thought: <b>nothingness</b>. Make use of the oaken <i>tub</i> from the previous frame, and add to that the <i>oven fire</i> at the bottom.		｜ノ一灬無
乱	riot, war, disorder, disturb		舌乙	riot	riot		In a <b>riot</b>, manners are laid aside and tempers get short, even in so courtesy-conscious a land as Japan. This kanji shows what happens to a <b>rioting</b> <i>tongue</i>: it gets "barbed" like a <i>fishhook</i>, and sets to attacking the opposition, to <i>hook</i> them as it were.		乙口舌
検	examination, investigate		木㑒	examination	examination		Tree . . . awl.		口人木𠆢
倹	frugal, economy, thrifty		人㑒	frugal	frugal		Person . . . awl.		⺅口人𠆢
齢	age		歯令	age	age		This character is used to express the years of one's <b>age</b>. Its elements: <i>teeth</i> . . . <i>orders</i>.		止歯米𠆢凵卩
噛	chew, bite, gnaw		口歯	chew	chew				口止歯米
墨	black ink, India ink, ink stick, Mexico		黒土	black ink	black ink		Besides meaning <b>black ink</b>, this kanji also appears in the word for an inked string that is pulled taut and snapped to mark a surface, much the same as one might used a chalked string. Here it is used to mark off the <i>dirt</i> with <i>black</i> lines for a foot ballgame (played, I presume, on a white field).		黒土里灬
走	run		十[mending]	run	run		<b>Running</b>, we are told here, <i>mends</i> the <i>soil</i>. Observe in the following frames how this kanji can embrace other elements from below, much the same way as the element for <i>road</i> does; and how, in order to do this, the final stroke needs to be lengthened.		走土
至	climax, arrive, proceed, reach, attain, result in		[wall]土	climax	climax		<i>Wall</i> . . . <i>soil</i>. The key word allows for the full variety of connotations: to peak, to arrive at the end, and the like.		一至土厶
益	benefit, gain, profit, advantage		丷䒑ハ皿	benefit	benefit		Poised over the <i>dish</i> here is a pair of <i>animal horns</i> that are attached to a pair of <i>animal legs</i> by a single horizontal stroke.		一皿ハ并


䒑	grass, straw, herbs, weeds					weeds	-	Editor's notes: This element was not introduced in RTK by Heisig but it's referenced in Kanji GOD by few kanjis. You can use this this primitive as it is (instead of row 並 or animal horns 丷) or alternatively you can use the row 並 primitive as described by Heisig, of which this primitive is part of.  You can decide case by case for each kanji this element is introduced in	一并

###### 衣 and 衤: Let's keep the 'cloak' separate entities since they are so distinct visually
衤	clothes, clothing radical (no. 145)					cloak	This is a variation of the <i>garment</i> primitive (衣). When it appears to the left, it looks like a hiragana ne (ネ) with an extra drop on the right (衤), and we shall take it to mean <i>cloak</i>.		衤
袖	sleeve, wing (building), extension, give cold shoulder		衤由	sleeve	sleeve		Cloak . . . sprout.		｜一衤田
襟	collar, neck, lapel, one's inner feelings		衤禁	collar	collar		Cloak . . . prohibition.		示二小衤木
褐	brown, woollen kimono		衤日匂[siesta]	brown	brown		The color of the serape or <i>cloak</i> of our muchacho on <i>siesta</i> is a dull <b>brown</b>, the color this kanji indicates.		衤日勹匕
衿	neck, collar, lapel		衤今	lapel	lapel				衤𠆢

###### keep scarf 𧘇 as a separate sub-primitive
𧘇		[scarf-unhooked]				scarf	A pictographic representation of a <b>scarf</b>. A sub-element of primitive <i>garment</i> (衣).	Note that when any of the above forms have something beneath them (as in frame 429 遠), the third from final stroke is "unhooked.": [scarf-unhooked]	
衣	garment, clothes, dressing	[top_hat_and_scarf]	亠𧘇	garment	garment		At the top we see the <i>top hat</i>, and at the bottom a pictographic representation of the folds of a <b>garment</b> or a <i>scarf</i>. If you break the "4-fold" fold into 2 sets of 2 strokes, you will find it easier to remember.	Used as a primitive, the additional meaning of a <i>cloak</i> will come in handy. What has to be noted particularly are the changes in shape the kanji can undergo when it becomes an element in other kanji. In fact, it is the most volatile of all the kanji we shall treat, and for that reason deserves special attention here. When it appears to the left, it looks like a hiragana ne (ネ) with an extra drop on the right (衤), and we shall take it to mean <i>cloak</i>.  On rare occasions, the element can be torn right across the middle, with the first 2 strokes appearing at the top and the last 4 at the bottom of another primitive or cluster of primitive, in which cases we shall speak of a <i>top hat and scarf</i>. And finally, of course, it can keep its original kanji shape, along with its original meaning of <i>garment</i> in general. 	衣亠
環	ring, circle, link, wheel		王罒一口𧘇	ring	ring		<i>Jewel</i> . . . <i>eye</i> . . . <i>ceiling</i> . . . <i>mouth</i> . . . <i>scarf</i>. The number of elements is large here, so take extra care. Learn it in conjunction with the next frame, since these are the only two cases in this book where the combination of elements to the right appears.		衣王口罒一
還	send back, return		罒一口𧘇辶	send back	send back		<i>Road</i> . . . <i>eye</i> . . . <i>ceiling</i> . . . <i>mouth</i> . . . scarf.		衣口辶罒一

####### fix 'mouth' vs 'pent in' primitive references
囗	box, box or enclosure radical (no. 31)					pent in	This primitive depicts a corral or pen surrounding something, which is thus <b>pent in</b>. [3]	Editor's note: The difference between 'pent in' and 'mouth' is that the former encloses the other primitives whereas the latter is mixed between them and can sometimes even overlap them.	囗口
口	mouth		口	mouth	mouth		Like several of the first characters we shall learn, the kanji for <b>mouth</b> is a clear pictograph. Since there are no circular shapes in the kanji, the square must be used to depict the circle.	As a primitive, this form also means <i>mouth</i>. Any of the range of possible images that the word suggests - an opening or entrance to a cave, a river, a bottle, or even the largest hole in your head - can be used for the primitive meaning. Editor's note: The difference between 'pent in' and 'mouth' is that the former encloses the other primitives whereas the latter is mixed between them and can sometimes even overlap them.	囗口
曰	say, reason, pretext, history, past, flat sun radical (no. 73)		口一	sayeth	sayeth		Pent in ... one. The key word refers to famous sayings of famous people, and is the origin for the primitive meaning of a tongue wagging in the mouth that we learned in FRAME 12. The size of this kanji, a relatively rare one, is what distinguishes it from day. [4]		曰
[lidded_crock]			土口			lidded crock	<i>Soil</i> over the <i>mouth</i> of a container gives us a piece of clay pottery with its lid. Behold the <b>lidded crock</b>. [6]		土囗

# update comment
母	mother	毋[mama-top]	母	mama	mama	breasts	Look closely at this kanji and you will find the outline of the kanji for <i>woman</i> in it, the second stroke of which has been expanded to make space for the two <b>breasts</b> that make her a <b>mama</b>. Likening this sound to a baby nursing at its mother's breast has afforded some scholars of comparative linguistics a way to explain the presence of the same word across a wide range of language groups.	As a primitive we shall add the meaning of <i>breasts</i> in accord with the explanation given above. Take careful note of the fact that the form is altered slightly when this kanji serves as a primitive, the final two dots joining together to form a longer stroke (毋).	母毋
⺍						owl	We have already met these three strokes before. When they come under another stroke, they represent a claw, and thence a vulture (爫). And when placed atop a roof structure, they create a schoolhouse (龸). The <b>owl</b> has something to do with both: it is a bird of prey, and it has come to be associated in the popular imagination with learning. [3]		

###### fix tiger primitive reference from 虍 to 虎
虐	tyrannize, oppress		虎匚一	tyrannize	tyrannize		<i>Tiger</i> . . . <i>box</i> with a <i>one</i> in it (or a backwards <i>broom</i>, if that makes it easier).		卜匕匚厂虍
虚	void, emptiness, unpreparedness, crack, fissure, untruth		虎业並	void	void	hollow	Tigers . . . <i>row</i>.		一卜匕厂虍
膚	skin, body, grain, texture, disposition		虎胃	skin	skin		Tiger . . . stomach.		月田卜匕厂虍
虜	captive, barbarian, low epithet for the enemy		虎男	captive	captive		Tiger . . . man.		田卜力匕厂虍
虔	respect		虎文	reserved	reserved				文卜匕厂虍
濾	filter		虎思水	strainer	strainer				氵田心厂卜
虞	fear, uneasiness, anxiety, concern, expectation, consideration		虎呉	uneasiness	uneasiness		Tiger . . . give.		口ハ卜匕厂虍
彪	spotted, mottled, patterned, small tiger		虎儿彡	mottled					卜儿匕厂彡虍

### add missing primitive keywords
气	spirit, steam radical (no. 84)		𠂉一乙			spirit	Spirit radical - a main component of its full kanji (気). Its elements are: <i>reclining</i> . . . <i>floor</i> . . . <i>fishhook</i>  Do not confuse with <i>spirits</i> (Frame 1930).		气
冖	wa-shaped crown radical (no. 14)					crown	This pictograph of a simple <b>crown</b> is distinguished from the roof only by the absence of the chimney (the first <i>drop</i> at the top). It can be used for all the principal connotations of the word <b>crown</b>. We will meet the full character from which this element is derived later on, in FRAME 326. [2]		冖

# removed 'Ma' primitive keyword
マ		ㄗ				chop-seal	The <b>chop-seal</b> (ㄗ) is the engraved piece of wood or stone used in the Orient to certify documents. Unlike the stamp (卩), the top stroke here reaches a good distance to the left of its vertical stroke. When it appears at the top of another primitive, it is abbreviated to マ		

#### 开 'two hands' primitive
# Add primitive alternative 廾
开	open, initiate, begin, start	廾				two hands	Let this primitive represent a union of <b>two hands</b>, both of which are used at the same time. Whenever this element appears at the bottom of its relative primitive, the top line is omitted (廾), whether or not there is a horizontal line to replace it. [4]		一ノ十干廾

####### fix primitive references from 廾 to 开
弁	valve, petal, braid, speech, dialect, discrimination, dispose of, distinguish, conical cap		厶开	valve	valve		Elbow . . . two hands.		厶廾
算	calculate, divining, number, abacus, probability		竹目开	calculate	calculate		Bamboo . . . eyes . . . two hands.		竹目廾
葬	interment, bury, shelve		艹死开	interment	interment		<i>Flowers</i> . . . <i>death</i> . . . <i>two hands</i>. Do not confuse with <i>bury</i> (Frame 191).		一夕匕廾⺾
戒	commandment		戈开	commandment	commandment		Two hands . . . fiesta.		廾戈
弄	play with, tamper, trifle with		玉开	tinker with	tinker with		Jewel . . . two hands.		王廾
弊	abuse, evil, vice, breakage		敝开	abuse	abuse		Shredder . . . two hands.		｜巾⺌并冂廾攵


###### Add 'upside down in a row' primitive keyword and remove 'average'
並	row, and, besides, as well as, line up, rank with, rival, equal	[row-bottom][in_a_row_upside_down]	䒑业	row	row	upside down in a row 	This character represents a slightly stylized duplication of the kanji for <i>stand up</i>. By lengthening the sixth and seventh strokes, you will see how this is done.	The primitive meaning remains the same as that of the kanji, but special attention has to be given to the varieties of shape this element can undergo. It is the most difficult one you will meet in this book. When it appears BENEATH its relative primitive, the top three strokes are omitted ([row-bottom]), though the third horizontal stroke may be doubled up with the bottom horizontal stroke of the element above it (as in 繊 or 湿). ATOP its relative primitive, it can keep its kanji shape. When it does not, the top three strokes are removed and all of them are replaced BELOW the primitive's bottom line ([in_a_row_upside_down] as in 業). We shall acknowledge this latter transformation by changing its meaning to <i>upside down in a row</i>. Editor's note: You can use the row 並 primitive as described by Heisig, or you can switch to use it's basic components 业 (spikes) and 䒑 (grass, weeds) which were not included in RTK. You can decide case by case for each kanji these elements are introduced in.   	｜一二并

###### 丿 'katakana' primitive
丿	katakana no radical (no. 4)					katakana	This is a non-Heisig primitive, added as a reference to those kanjis which contain one stroke such as this and in which Heisig doesn't explicitely state it should be a 'drop' ( 丶 )primitive		ノ

###### 亦 apple / 赤 red primitives
亦	also, again		亠刀小			apple	<i>Top hat</i> . . . <i>dagger</i> . . . <i>little</i>. The two strokes of the <i>dagger</i> take the place of the middle stroke of <i>little</i>.		ノハ亅亠
赤	red	亦	一亦	red	red		<i>Ground</i> . . . <i>dagger</i> . . . <i>little</i>. The two strokes of the <i>dagger</i> take the place of the middle stroke of <i>little</i>.	As a primitive on the left, this kanji keeps the same form. Elsewhere, the first two strokes are abbreviated to a single dot (亦). This latter form will take the meaning of an <i>apple</i>.	赤土

###### 天 heaven / 夭 witch
夭	early death, calamity		一大			witch	Pay special attention to the fact that here the first stroke is written right to left, rather like the first stroke of thousand (FRAME 40), rather than left to right (天 heavens)		ノ大
天	heavens, sky, imperial		一大	heavens	heavens		This character is meant to be a pictograph of a great man, said to represent the Lord of the <b>Heavens</b>. (You may, of course, use the elements <i>ceiling</i> and <i>St. Bernard</i> instead.)	The primitive can mean either the <i>heaven</i> of eternal bliss or the general term for sky, the <i>heavens</i>. Pay special attention to the fact that in its primitive form the first stroke is written right to left, rather like the first stroke of thousand (Frame 40), rather than left to right. From the next character, we shall give it the primitive meaning of a <i>witch 夭</i>.	一大
矢	dart, arrow		ノ丶天	dart	dart		When shot high into the <i>heavens</i>, the <b>dart</b> gets so small it looks like a mere <i>drop</i>. Although this character could as well mean "arrow," it has no connection with the primitive of that meaning. Hence the new key word.		ノ大一矢

# This is actually 'witch' and not 'heavens' (mistake in Heisigs' book)
笑	laugh		竹夭	laugh	laugh		Bamboo . . . witch.		禾竹大

##### 禺 'talking cricket' primitive 
禺	long-tailed monkey		田虫冂			talking cricket	we may combine the <i>insect</i> with a <i>brain</i> (observe the writing) and a <i>belt</i> to create the <i>Talking Cricket</i> who served as Pinocchio's conscience. (<i>The belt</i> is there because he pulls it off to give unrepentant little Pinocchio a bit of "strap" now and again.)		田日禸冂
偶	accidentally, even number, couple, man & wife, same kind		人禺	accidentally	accidentally		The <i>person</i> on the left is familiar. As for the right side, we can see the <i>Talking cricket</i> 		⺅田冂厶禸

###### 聿 brush: fix 'brush top' image
聿	brush, finally, self, relate, follow, here, fast, writing brush radical (no. 129)	[brush-top]	一肀			brush	This primitive element, not itself a kanji, is a pictograph of a writing <b>brush</b>. Let the first 3 strokes represent the hairs at the tip of the <b>brush</b>, and the following two strokes the thumb and forefinger that guide it when you write. Note how the long vertical stroke, cutting through everything, is drawn last. This is standard procedure when you have such a stroke running the length of a character. However, as we saw in the case of <i>cow</i>, when this primitive appears on top of another primitive, its “tail” is cut off ([brush-top]) [6]		聿


####### Remove references to odd archaic primitives without Heisig keyword. 
## Let's keep these in mind though, since they could become handy if they are shared by more than one kanji so we could crowdsource their keyword and mnemonics
# removed 甬
通	traffic, pass through, avenue, commute, counter for letters, notes, documents, etc.		マ用辶	traffic	traffic		<i>Chop-seal</i> . . . <i>utilize</i> . . . <i>road</i>. By combining the first two primitives into a single image, you will be able to use that image in a few instances later, one of which comes immediately.		辶用マ
踊	jump, dance, leap, skip		足マ用	jump	jump		Wooden <i>leg</i> . . . <i>chop-seal</i> . . . <i>utilize</i>.		口足用マ

喚	yell, cry, call, scream, summon		口勹四大	yell	yell		The <i>mouth</i> on the left is obvious. The rest is harder. Try this: <i>four St. Bernard dogs bound up</i> in a bunch. Together they should supply a clear enough portrait of a <b>yell</b>, provided you are careful to see all <i>four</i> of them. Note how the final stroke of the <i>four</i> is supplied by the long horizontal stroke of the <i>St .Bernard</i>.		口大儿冂勹
# removed 畀 and added missing primitives
鼻	nose, snout		自田开	nose	nose		Let me share a rather grotesque image to help with this kanji. Imagine taking your <i>two hands</i> and reaching up into someone's <i>nostrils</i>. Once inside you grab hold of the <i>brain</i> and yank it out. At the end, you would have a picture something like that of this character, the full kanji for <b>nose</b>.		自田廾鼻
# removed 叚
暇	spare time, rest, leisure, time, leave of absence		日[staples]口又	spare time	spare time		The element for <i>day</i> on the left is logical enough. Next to it we see <i>staples</i> being held in <i>mouth</i> (one stroke is doubled up), indicating working in one's hobby or handicrafts at home on one's <b>spare time</b>. The small <i>box</i> at the top right is facing backwards, or more properly "inside out." Finally, we have the <i>crotch</i> at the bottom.		日又
# removed 㠯
遣	dispatch, despatch, send, give, donate, do, undertake		[purse]𠂤辶	dispatch	dispatch		This kanji takes a<i>way</i> the <i>maestro</i>'s baton and replaces it with a <i>purse</i>. The <i>road</i> represents his being <b>dispatched</b> on his <i>way</i> a san obvious misfit. You will remember that when he did have his baton, he was being <i>chased</i> down the <i>road</i> by his fans. All of which shows what a difference a single stroke can make!		｜一口辶

鬱	gloom, depression, melancholy, luxuriant		缶木木冖乂丶凵匕彡	gloom	gloom		Learning this character will take a little doing. Before we start, it is a good idea to keep the key word distinct from <i>melancholy</i> (Frame 663), with which it combines to create the psychological condition of depression (a metaphor based on the hollow or sinking of the material <i>depression</i> we met in Frame 1421). The picture of <b>gloom</b> begins with a small <i>grove</i> of <i>tree</i>s, under which we see a <i>crown</i> made out of used <i>tin cans</i>. Next (the lower half of the kanji) we find a combination that appears only a few times in modern characters and only once in those treated in the volumes of <i>Remembering the Kanji</i>. It is composed of a <i>shovel</i> with a <i>sheaf</i> dotted with small <i>drops</i> on all sides. Think of it as a large scoop <i>shovel</i> attached to the front of a bulldozer, whose driver is singing: ♪ "Bulldozing in the <i>sheaves</i>, bulldozing in the <i>sheaves</i>..." ♪ The <i>drops</i> represent the chaff flying about as the <i>sheaves</i> are tossed about by the heavy machinery. There is <i>someone sitting on the ground</i> alongside, watching as the machinery makes its way around the neighboring farmland - and it's you, wearing your <i>tin-can crown</i>. You feel overwhelmed by the impending doom as the invasion of agro-business draws closer and closer to the <i>grove</i>, the only patch of woods that remains of what once was a vast forest. The whole scene represents a re-<i>shaping</i> of the natural environment that brings the heavy weight of <b>gloom</b> down upon you. A bit much, perhaps, but there are enough elements to allow for any number of other combinations.		缶木冖凵匕彡

# remove 丽 and it's primitive alternative names, switch to 凡凡
丽									
麗	lovely, beautiful, graceful, resplendent		一凡凡鹿	lovely	lovely		The painting of a <i>deer</i> itself with its form and color is enough to fill the bill for an image of something <b>lovely</b>. But to give a bit of contrast, we see two <i>mediocre</i> drawings from a later age on two patches of <i>ceiling</i> above. Note that the drop in <i>mediocre</i> has been lengthened somewhat and the second stroke drawn down straight.		一鹿比冂广


##### Add [eel] and [bucket_of_eels] primitive alternatives
亀	tortoise, turtle	[eel][bucket_of_eels]	勹日日	tortoise	tortoise	eel, bucket of eels	This is not a <i>turtle</i> (See frame 250) but a <b>tortoise</b>, however you wish to picture the difference. Let the "<i>bound up</i>" at the to prefer to the head, and the two <i>suns</i>, with a long tail running through it, to the shell.	When this kanji is abbreviated to its bottom half ([eel]), it takes the primitive meaning of an eel. When only the first two strokes are omitted ([bucket_of_eels), it will mean a bucket of eels. Examples of this latter will not appear until Vol. 3.	亀田勹乙
俺	I, myself		人大亀	myself	myself		The key word refers to a very familiar way of referring to oneself, typically used by men. Its component elements: <i>person</i> . . . <i>St. Bernard</i> . . . <i>eel</i>.		乙⺅大奄
電	electricity		雨亀	electricity	electricity		Rain/weather . . . eel.		雨田乙
竜	dragon, imperial		立亀	dragon	dragon		<i>Vase</i> . . . <i>eel</i>. In order not to confuse this kanji with the zodiacal <i>sign of the dragon</i>, which we will meet later (Frame 2164) and use as a primitive, you might think here of a paper parade <b>dragon</b>.		立竜田乙
縄	straw rope, cord		糸日亀	straw rope	straw rope		Thread . . . eels.		亀糸幺小田乙勹
电									


##### 茲 double mysterious
茲	here		玄玄			double mysterious	Note the doubling up of the element for <i>top hat</i> in the primitive for <i>mysterious</i> and assign it a special image.		幺⺾
滋	nourishing, more & more, be luxuriant, planting, turbidity		水茲	nourishing	nourishing		<i>Water</i> . . . double-<i>mysterious</i>. 		一氵并幺

##### 平 water lily
平	even, flat, peace	乎	平	even	even	water lily	This character is easiest remembered as a pictograph of a water lily floating on the surface of the water, which gives it its meaning of <b>even</b>. The fourth stroke represents the calm, smooth surface of a pond, and the final stroke the long stem of the plant reaching underwater.	As a primitive, this kanji can keep its pictographic meaning of a <i>water lily</i>.	干并
呼	call, call out to, invite		口平	call	call		<i>Mouth</i> . . . <i>water lily</i>. Note: this is the one time that the "stem" has a barb at the end. Work this fact into your story.	Editor's note: The first stroke of water lily is also here a bit curved and drawn from right to left. There is a separate kanji for this (乎) but it's not singled out as a separate kanji because it's so rare. 	ノ口并亅
# not water lily, even though this (instead of 平) is the character used in 呼
乎	question mark, ?								ノ一并亅

##### 兆 portent (separate the 丬 alternative primitive)
兆	portent, 10**12, trillion, sign, omen, symptoms		兆	portent	portent	turtle	Here we have a pictograph of the back of a turtle, the two sloping vertical strokes representing the central ridge and the four short strokes the pattern. Think of reading turtle shells as a way to foretell the future, and in particular things that <b>portend</b> coming evils. When this character is used as a primitive in its full form, we keep the key-word sense of a <i>portent</i>. 		儿冫
丬	half of tree trunk, rad. no. 90					turtle	When the portent (兆) appears to the left in its abbreviated form (namely, the left half only 丬), we shall give it the pictographic sense of a <i>turtle</i>.		｜冫


##### 行 going (keep separate the 彳 alternative primitive)
# Also add 'boulevard' primitive keyword
行	going, journey, carry out, conduct, act, line, row, bank		彳一丁	going	going	boulevard	By joining the top four strokes, you should get a picture of the front current of a river, the stream trailing behind. Hence the character for <b>going</b>.	As a primitive, this character has two forms. Reduced to the left side only, it can mean a <i>column</i>, <i>going</i>, or a <i>line</i> of something or other. When the middle is opened up to make room for other elements, it means a <i>boulevard</i>.	行彳
彳	stop, linger, loiter, going man radical (no. 60)					act, line, column	When the kanji for 'going' (行) is reduced to the left side only, it can mean a <i>column</i>, <i>going</i>, or a <i>line</i> of something or other. 		彳


# this is already listed as alternative for 开
廾	twenty, twenty or letter H radical (no. 55)								廾


# Add commentary
[hairpin]						hairpin	Here we have a quasi-pictograph of the colorful and decorated clips used to bind up long hair. Note its similarity to the scarf 𧘇, which differs only by the addition of one stroke. [4]	Editor's note: Notice also the similarity with rags [rags] which is missing the hook in its second stroke	

# scarf instead of rags
表	surface, table, chart, diagram		龶𧘇	surface	surface		<i>Grow up</i> . . . <i>scarf</i>. This character represents the "outside" of a garment, just as the kanji for <i>back</i> (Frame 426) depicted the "inside" or lining.	Editor's note: The primitive used here is in fact 'scarf' (𧘇) and not 'rags' ([rags]). 	衣士

# [rags] - fix link
旅	trip, travel		[banner][rags]	trip	trip		Let the last 4 strokes, which are also the concluding strokes to the character for <i>garment</i>, represent a <i>rag</i> as its primitive meaning. We shall meet this only on one other occasion. This gives us as our elements: <i>banner</i> . . . <i>rag</i>.		['ノ方一']

##### The new 𠂢 bifurcate primitive
𠂢	to branch		[rags]⺁			bifurcate	This is a non-Heisig primitive and even though he did not assign it a keyword, he did note these common building blocks. It will come handy with the two kanjis that refer to it because of its meaning. To avoid collision with two other branch related kanjis (branch 支 and branch off 岐) we name this <b>bifurcate</b>		ノ斤
派	faction, group, party, clique, sect, school		水[rags]⺁𠂢	faction	faction		<i>Water</i> . . . <i>drag</i> . . . <i>rag</i>. Back in frame 1127 we indicated that this latter radical would come up once again, as it does in this and the following two frames.	Editor's note: You can use the non-Heisig <i>bifurcate</i> primitive instead of <i>rags</i> and <i>drag</i>	斤氵厂
脈	vein, pulse, hope		肉⺁[rags]𠂢	vein	vein		Part of body . . . <i>drag</i> . . . <i>rag</i>.	Editor's note: You can use the <i>bifurcate</i> primitive instead of <i>rags</i> and <i>drag</i>	斤月厂

# fix [drag-bottom] link 
⺁	drag	[drag-bottom]	⺁		drag		Although not a pictograph in the strict sense, this primitive depicts one stroke pulling another along behind it. Note how it differs from cliff and person because of this <i>drag</i>ging effect,not to mention the fact that the first stroke is written right to left, almost as if it were a long drop. When this element comes under a different element, the strokes are drawn apart like this: [drag-bottom] [2]		
乑	stand side by side, assemble		⺁[rags]				Note here the abbreviated form of </i>drag</i>: [drag-bottom]		｜丶ノ

# add comment/reference to [drag-bottom]
冫	two-stroke water radical or ice radical (no. 15)	⺀				ice	The condensation of the three drops we have been using to mean <i>water</i> into two drops signals the solidifying of <i>water</i> into <b>ice</b>. Note that when this primitive appears to the left, it is written like the last two strokes of the element for <i>water</i>, 冫, whereas under another primitive, it is written like the first two strokes of the water primitive: ⺀. [2]	Editor's note: Please see the distiction in the stroke direction between ⺀ and special form of the 'drag' ⺁ primitive: [drag-bottom]	冫

### add primitives
裟	Buddhist surplice		水小衣	monk’s sash	monk’s sash				ノ衣氵小
裡	reverse, inside, palm, sole, rear, lining, wrong side		衣里	back (old)	back (old)				衤里

# 乂 sheaf primitive
乂	mow, cut grass, subdue					sheaf	These two strokes are a crude drawing of a bundle of stalks bound together into a sheaf. [2]		ノ


##### these do not have Heisig primitive keyword attached
巷	fork in road, scene, arena, theater								ハ已井
襄	rise, raise								｜衣一ハ亠
齊	alike, equal, similar, Saito								齊亠刀氏廾
已	stop, halt, previously, already, long ago			stop short	stop short		This character can be kept distinct from the familiar sign of the snake 巳 (1.2042) by noting that the final stroke stops short. [3]	Editor's note: Also keep distinct from kanji 己 self.	已
愈	be superior, heal, more and more, increasingly, finally, beyond doubt		亼刖心	in the nick of time	in the nick of time		Meeting of butchers . . . heart. [13]		刂月心𠆢

# 卆 'game of cricket' primitive
卆	soldier, private, die					game of cricket	Here we have a <i>baseball</i> and <i>needle</i>. Since they will be coming together from time to time, let us give the two of them the sense of a <i>game of cricket</i> in which a <i>needle</i> is laid across the wicket.		九十
砕	smash, break, crush, familiar, popular		石卆	smash	smash		We begin with the two elements on the right, <i>baseball</i> and <i>needle</i>. Since they will be coming together from time to time, let us give the two of them the sense of a <i>game of cricket</i> in which a <i>needle</i> is laid across the wicket. Then imagine using a <i>rock</i> for a ball. A <b>smash</b> hit would probably splinter the bat in all directions, and a <b>smashing</b> pitch would do the same with the <i>needle</i> wicket.		ノ口十石九

# 冘 'crown tied around leg of person' primitive
沈	sink, be submerged, subside, be depressed, aloes		水冘	sink	sink		The technique for <b>sinking</b> used in this kanji is unique. Rather than the biblical image of tying a millstone about the victim's neck, here we see a <i>crown tied about one leg</i> before the unfortunate party is tossed into the <i>water</i>.		氵
冘	to move on, doubtful		冖人儿			crown tied around leg of person.			ノ乙冖尢

# this isn't schoolhouse (note the difference in the stroke angle of the second stroke

# ⺷ isn't grow up (龶)
⺷									
# fix primitive form ⺷ to 龶
憲	constitution, law		宀龶罒心	constitution	constitution		The key word refers to the fundamental guiding principles of a government or other organization. Its elements: <i>House</i> . . . <i>grow up</i> . . . <i>eyes</i> . . . <i>heart</i>.		心土罒亠宀

# 朿 thorn / 'belted tree' primitive
朿	thorn					belted tree			｜一ハ木冂
刺	thorn, pierce, stab, prick, sting, calling card		朿刀	thorn	thorn		<b>Thorns</b> grow on a bush here that has wrapped itself around a <i>tree</i> like a <i>belt</i>, cutting into the poor <i>tree</i> like little <i>sabers</i>. [8]	Editor's note: Here we use the 朿 primitive which in fact means 'thorn' itself. So 刺 here is the full kanji. 	｜刂巾ハ木亅冂
棗	jujube		朿朿						｜一巾ハ木亠冂
棘	thorn, splinter, spine, biting words, briers		朿朿	thornbush	thornbush				｜巾ハ木亠冂

莿	thorn		⺾朿刀						冂刂⺾木



# 兑 'devil' primitive. Removed reference to 兌. Added comments
兑						devil	The two horns on the head of the teenager are enough to suggest to most parents of adolescents a good image of a devil. [7]		
脱	undress, removing, escape from, get rid of, be left out, take off		肉兑	undress	undress		To <b>undress</b> is to expose the <i>flesh</i> and tempt the <i>devil</i> in the eyes of one’s onlookers. Ignore the moral if you want, but not the devil. [11]		月口并儿

# Add comment
丗	thirty					buckle	Pictograph of a buckle.		｜山十

# fix primitives
亜	Asia, rank next, come after, -ous		｜一口	Asia	Asia	sub	In this kanji, the abbreviation for <b>Asia</b>, you should be able to see the character for <i>mouth</i> behind the Roman numeral II.		｜一口

# [rags]
[rags]						rags	-	Editor's note. This is a sub-primitive for 衣 garment and its last 4 concluding strokes. The difference with scarf 𧘇 is the missing hook in its second stroke. Note also the similarity with the hairpin [hairpin] primitive.	

# 辛 spicy: Add 'red pepper' primitive alternative
辛	spicy, bitter, hot, acrid		立十	spicy	spicy	red pepper	This character pictures food whose taste is so hot and <b>spicy</b> that it makes the hairs on your body <i>stand up</i> as straight as <i>needles</i>.	As a primitive, we shall use this meaning of <i>spicy</i>, except when the two extra strokes are added to the bottom, giving it the form of a tree. Then we take its alternate meaning of a <i>red pepper</i> plant. The connection is obvious.	十辛立
親	parent, intimacy, relative, familiarity, dealer (cards)		立木辛見	parent	parent		Red pepper . . . see.		見十辛并木立亠
新	new		立木辛斤	new	new		Red pepper . . . ax.		斤十辛并木立亠

# Added '-' to empty Heisig stories. Otherwise Kanji GOD will not show Heisig comments.
侖	think, be methodical		亼冊				-	Editors' note: Non-Heisig keyword	𠆢冂廾冊
尃	to state to, to announce		十田寸			acupuncturist	-	Editor's note: This kanji in fact is the 'acupuncturist' (a doctor without his needle) referred to in 博 (Dr.) by Heisig.	一｜丶十寸日
业						spikes	-	Editor's notes: This element was not introduced in RTK by Heisig but it's referenced in Kanji GOD by few kanjis. You can use this this primitive as it is or alternatively you can use the row 並 primitive as described by Heisig, of which this primitive is part of.  You can decide case by case for each kanji this element is introduced in	
罒	net radical variant (no. 122)	网				eye	-	Editor's note: This net radical 罒 (referred by Heisig as eye turned on its side) has a different meaning from the normal eye kanji (目). We'll keep these as separate primitives, but for each kanji you can use either Heisig's mnemonics (which doesn't differentiate the two) or substitute a different keyword to your own story using this 罒 primitive. Suggestions: Spider's net, internet or fishing net.	罒

# Add comparison between mending, critters and correct
疋	head, counter for animals			critters	critters	zoo	Rather than use this for animals in general, we will refer to it as a <b>zoo</b>, to avoid confusion with the other animals that will be showing up. Except for the downward hook at the end of the first stroke, this element is indistinguishable from <i>mending</i> ([mending]). Perhaps by now you have developed a quick eye for such details. If not now, you will before long. [5]	Editors' note: Please also compare to 正 (kanji for 'correct')	疋
正	correct, justice, righteous, 10**40		一止	correct	correct		"A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step," says the Chinese proverb. Here we see <i>one footprint</i>, complementing that proverb with the sound advice that if the first step is not made <b>correctly</b>, the whole point of the journey will be forfeited. This is the ideal that teachers are supposed to have in <b>correcting</b> their students, and parents in <b>correcting</b> their children.	Editor's note: Please compare also to 正 (kanji for 'correct') and mending ([mending])	一止
[mending]						mending	This primitive differs from the kanji for <i>correct</i> (正) only by the movement added to the last two strokes, the “-ing” of <b>mending</b> if you will. But take a more concrete sense, like <b>mending</b> holes in socks. [5]	Editor's note: Please also compare to primitive 'critters' (疋)
