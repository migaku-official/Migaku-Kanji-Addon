# Add Heisig stories
書	write		聿日	write	write		The sage talks rapidly with his <i>tongue wagging in his mouth</i>, while the <i>brush</i> of the scribe runs apace to <b>write</b> down the master’s words. [10]		日聿
冗	superfluous, uselessness		冖几	superfluous	superfluous		Picture a <i>weather</i> vane beneath a regal <i>crown</i>, spinning round and round. It is not only <b>superfluous</b> but makes a perfect ass out of the one who wears it. [4]		冖几
布	linen, cloth, spread, distribute		𠂇巾	linen	linen		The maid, <i>towels</i> <i>by her side</i>, distributes the <b>linen</b>. [5]		ノ一巾
鏡	mirror, speculum, barrel-head, round rice-cake offering		金竟	mirror	mirror		After lakes but before glass, polished <i>metal</i> was used for mirrors. These <i>metal</i> <b>mirrors</b> are recalled in this character for a <b>mirror</b>. [19]		音金日立儿
各	each, every, either		夂口	each	each		“Suum cuique” goes the popular Latin proverb. A certain disease of the English language makes it almost impossible to translate the phrase without gender bias. In any event, here we see someone walking with his/her <i>mouth</i> between his/her <i>walking legs</i>, giving us an image of “To <b>each</b> his/her own.” [6]	The sense of the proverb should help when using this kanji as a primitive; otherwise, reduce it to its original elements. But do not associate it in any way with the word "every," which we shall meet later in another context.	口夂攵

# fix primitive
亜	Asia, rank next, come after, -ous		丨一口	Asia	Asia	sub	In this kanji, the abbreviation for <b>Asia</b>, you should be able to see the character for <i>mouth</i> behind the Roman numeral II.		｜一口
㐮	grass skirt		衣八[celery]	grass skirt	grass skirt		This unusual looking <b>grass skirt</b> is composed of a <i>top hat and scarf</i>, and eight <i>celery</i> sticks. [13]		衣ハ亠
裁	tailor, judge, decision, cut out (pattern)		𢦏衣	tailor	tailor		You might think here of <i>garment</i> that have been specially <b>tailored</b> for <i>Thanksgiving</i> celebrations to look like traditional Pilgrim garb.		土亠厶戈衣
或	some, one, or, possibly, a certain		戈口一	a  (a certain)	a  (a certain)				口戈一

# remove non-Heisig primitive 鬲
隔	isolate, alternate, distance, separate, gulf		⻖一口儿冂丁	isolate	isolate		<i>Pinnacle</i> . . . <i>ceiling</i> . . . <i>mouth</i> . . . <i>glass canopy</i> . . . <i>human legs</i> . . . <i>spike</i>. You might want to compare the kanji for <i>dissolve</i> (Frame 1123).		一口儿冂⻖鬲

# add ⺹ primitive alternative
老	old man, old age, grow old	⺹	老匕	old man	old man		First, do not confuse this character with <i>venerable old man</i> (Frame 849), which is far more rarely used. The character for an <b>old man</b> begins with an abbreviation of the character for <i>somebody</i>, the <i>nose</i> having been shortened into a simple crisscross of lines. But there is another, simpler way to remember it all: the <i>soil</i> drawn first indicates that one has come close to the age when "dust to dust" begins to take on a personal meaning; the diagonal <i>walking stick</i> for getting around; and the <i>spoon</i> for being spoon-fed.	As a primitive, the meaning is the same, but the final two strokes are omitted (⺹) so that they can be replaced with other elements.	⺹

# add 'arm' primitive keyword
[arm]						arm, tucked under the arm	The picture of an <b>arm</b> dangling from the trunk of the body gives us the element for <b>arm</b>, or <b>tucked under the arm</b> (relative to the element below it). Examples of both usages follow. Unlike most primitives, the kanji that bears the same meaning (FRAME 1522) has absolutely no connection with it. [2]		


#### 'march' primitive: switch from 戍 to 戌
戌	sign of the dog, 7-9PM, eleventh sign of Chinese zodiac		丶戊		march		As distinct from the <i>parade</i>, the <b>march</b> points to a formal demonstration, whose emotions are generally a far cry from the happy spirit of the <i>parade</i>. The inclusion of the one gives the sense of the singlemindedness and unity of the group joined in the <b>march</b>. As was the case with <i>parade</i>, the primitive inside the enclosure indicates who or what is <b>marching</b>. [6]		ノ戈丶厂
戍	protection		丶戊						ノ丶戈厂
感	emotion, feeling, sensation		戌口心	emotion	emotion		<i>Mouth</i>s . . . <i>march</i>ing . . . <i>heart</i>.		ノ口心戈
歳	year-end, age, occasion, opportunity		止戌小	year-end	year-end		<i>Stop</i> . . . <i>march</i> . . . <i>little</i>. Be sure not to forget that final dot in the element for <i>march</i>.		ノ止小戈
減	dwindle, decrease, reduce, decline, curtail, get hungry		水戌口	dwindle	dwindle		A group of unquenchable <i>mouths</i> sets out on a <i>march</i> across the country, drinking <i>water</i> wherever they find it until the <i>water</i> supply has <b>dwindled</b> to a trickle, triggering a national disaster.		口氵亅戈
滅	destroy, ruin, overthrow, perish		水戌火	destroy	destroy		Picture a <i>march</i> of <i>flames</i> demonstrating against the Fire Department for their right to <b>destroy</b>, but being doused with <i>water</i> by the police riot squads.		ノ火氵戈
威	intimidate, dignity, majesty, menace, threaten		戌女	intimidate	intimidate		Here we see a <i>march</i> of <b>women</b> demonstrating on behalf of equal rights, something extremely <b>intimidating</b> to the male chauvinist population. [9]		ノ女戈厂
蔑	ignore, despise, neglect, ridicule		艹罒戌	revile	revile		The verbal abuse involved in <b>reviling</b> those who do not deserve it can be compared to a <i>march of flowers</i> in full boom having an <i>eyeball</i> of nastiness cast over them (literally, of course).		ノ罒戈⺾


# Add meaning
剝	come off, peel, fade, discolor		彑水刀						亅冫刂ヨ彑水

# fix radical lists
裏	back, amidst, in, reverse, inside, palm, sole, rear, lining, wrongside		衣里	back	back		An innocent looking <i>top hat and scarf</i> lying there in front of you, turned over, reveal a hidden <i>computer</i> sewn into the <b>back</b> of each - obviously the tools of a master spy. Such expe<i>ri</i>ences teach one always to have a look at the <b>back</b> side of things.		衣里亠
旅	trip, travel		[banner][rags]	trip	trip		Let the last 4 strokes, which are also the concluding strokes to the character for <i>garment</i>, represent a <i>rag</i> as its primitive meaning. We shall meet this only on one other occasion. This gives us as our elements: <i>banner</i> . . . <i>rag</i>.		ノ方一
褒	praise, extol		衣保	praise	praise		<i>Top hat and scarf</i> . . . <i>protect</i>. Note that the "tree" in <i>protect</i> becomes a <i>wooden pole</i> here.		衣⺅口小亠
哀	pathetic, grief, sorrow, pathos, pity, sympathize		衣口	pathetic	pathetic		A drunken sod in a tattered <i>top hat</i> and soiled silk <i>scarf</i> with a giant <i>mouth</i> guzzling something or other gives us a <b>pathetic</b> character role in which W. C. Fields might find himself right at home.		衣口亠
衰	decline, wane, weaken		衣口一	decline	decline		Let this key word connote the <b>decline</b> and fall of the Roman Empire. It shows a fellow in a <i>top hat</i> and <i>scarf</i>, trying hard to look happy by putting a <i>walking stick</i> in his <i>mouth</i> sideways to twist his face into a grotesque but semi permanent smile.		衣一亠
衷	inmost, heart, mind, inside		衣口丨	inmost	inmost		Between the <i>top hat</i> and the <i>scarf</i> you will see the character for <i>in</i> which is truncated at the bottom so as not to interfere with the <i>scarf</i>. You can think of this character forming as a pair with that of the former frame: there the <i>in</i> (the <i>walking stick</i> in the <i>mouth</i>) was set on its side; here it is set upright.		衣十口

# Add another primitive alternatives: 亚
並	row, and, besides, as well as, line up, rank with, rival, equal	亚[row-bottom][in_a_row_upside_down]	䒑业	row	row	upside down in a row	This character represents a slightly stylized duplication of the kanji for <i>stand up</i>. By lengthening the sixth and seventh strokes, you will see how this is done.	The primitive meaning remains the same as that of the kanji, but special attention has to be given to the varieties of shape this element can undergo. It is the most difficult one you will meet in this book. When it appears BENEATH its relative primitive, the top three strokes are omitted, though the third horizontal stroke may be doubled up with the bottom horizontal stroke of the element above it ([row-bottom] as in 繊 or 湿). ATOP its relative primitive, it can keep its kanji shape. When it does not, the top three strokes are removed and all of them are replaced BELOW the primitive's bottom line ([in_a_row_upside_down] as in 業). We shall acknowledge this latter transformation by changing its meaning to <i>upside down in a row</i>. Editor's note: You can use the row 並 primitive as described by Heisig, or you can switch to use it's basic components 业 (spikes) and 䒑 (grass, weeds) which were not included in RTK. You can decide case by case for each kanji these elements are introduced in.   	｜一二并

# fix primitives
[piglets]			一勿			piglets	This abbreviation of the full primitive for a sow, quite naturally, means <b>piglets</b>. [5]	Editor's note: Combination of a pictograph and mnemonics: Row of <b>piglets</b>, <i>one</i> of which (the rightmost) has its tail curved, almost as if it's been tied to a "knot" (勿 not)	

# add 者 primitive_alternative
者	someone, person	者	老日	someone	someone	puppet	<i>Old man</i> . . . <i>sun</i>. This key word looks to be difficult because of its proximity to <i>somebody</i>. In fact, it is a very common kanji that will cause you no difficulty at all. Its meaning should be seen as the human referent for the abstract noun "something."	As a primitive it means a <i>puppet</i>-on-a-string.	日⺹

# add 步 primitive_alternative
歩	walk, counter for steps	步	止少	walk	walk		<i>Footprints</i> that follow one another a <i>few</i> at a time indicate <b>walking</b>.		ノ止小



# from excel sheet
騙	deceive		馬扁	cheat	cheat				｜一戸馬冂冊尸
摘	pinch, pick, pluck, trim, clip, summarize		扌啇	pinch	pinch		<i>Finger</i> . . . antique.	Editor's note: to <b>pluck</b> a flower <b>pinch</b> the <i>stalk</i> 啇 with your <i>hand</i>	口十并立亠冂扌滴
痄	scrofulous swellings and sores		疒乍						一｜ノ疒
廻	round, game, revolve, go around, circumference		廴回	circling	circling				口囗廴
譃			言虎						一｜丶ノ匕卜厂虍言
頇	large face, flat face, stupid		干頁						一ハ十干目貝頁
茹	boil, seethe		艹如						口女⺾
來	come, due, next, cause, become		木人人						｜一十人ハ木
齒	tooth, cog		歯						止歯人凵米
葱	stone leek, Welsh onion		艹忽丶	onion	onion				勿心丶⺾
申	have the honor to, sign of the monkey, 3-5PM, ninth sign of Chinese zodiac		日丨	speaketh	speaketh	monkey	The olde English is used here to indicate a humble form of the third person singular of the verb "to speak." It is written by a <i>tongue wagging in the mouth</i> with a <i>walking stick</i> rammed through it and coming out at both ends.	While this kanji has obvious affinities to the "seed" group, it also happens to be the zodiacal sign of the <i>monkey</i> (the one who <i>speaketh</i> no evil, among other things). We shall therefore take <i>monkey</i> as its primitive meaning.	｜日田
播	plant, sow		扌番	disseminate	disseminate				田釆米扌
紘	large		糸𠂇厶	chinstrap	chinstrap				ノ一糸幺小厶
笘	whip, cane, wooden writing slate		竹占						口竹卜
魚	fish		勹田火	fish	fish		The composition of this kanji shows three elements, which we list in the order of their writing: <i>bound up</i> . . . <i>rice field</i> . . . <i>cooking fire</i>. Not much to work with at first sight. But we can join them together by thinking of a three-part story: first a <b>fish</b> is caught and <i>bound up</i> on a line with its unfortunate school-mates; when the fisherman gets home, he cuts off the head and tosses it, with the entrails, out into the <i>rice fields</i> for fertilizer; and the rest he sets in a skillet over a <i>cooking fire</i> for his supper.		魚田灬
牛	cow	⺧	牛	cow	cow		Can you see the "doodle" of a <b>cow</b> that has just been run over by a steamroller? The small dot in the first stroke shows its head turned to one side, and the next two strokes, the four legs.	As a primitive, the same sense of <i>cow</i> is kept. Note only that when it is placed OVER another element, its tail is cut off. In this case, and when the element appears on the left, the stroke order is changed.	牛
勿	not, must not, do not, be not		勿	not	not	knot	First take the primitive meaning of this character: <i>knot</i>. Think of it as the <i>piglet</i> minus its body (the horizontal stroke), that is, the curly tail that looks like a <i>knot</i>. As an exception, we will use the homonym to remember the abstract key word, <b>not</b>.		ノ勹勿
里	ri, village, parent's home, league		田土	ri	ri	computer	That's right - a <b><i>ri</i></b>. Don't bother looking it up in your English dictionary; it's a Japanese word for measuring distances. One <b><i>ri</i></b> is about 4 kilometers or 2.5 miles. The kanji depicts how the measure came to be used. Atop we see the <i>rice field</i>, and below the element for <i>land</i>. Those four sections you see in the <i>rice field</i> (and which we made mention of when first we introduced the character in frame 14) are actually measurements of <i>land</i>, much the same as farm-sections in the United States have given us the notion of a "country mile." The <i>land</i> division based on the size of a <i>rice field</i> is called a <b><i>ri</i></b>.	To get a more concrete primitive meaning for this kanji, we shall refer to it as a <i>computer</i>, a meaning deriving from the kanji for <i>logic</i>, which we will meet in Lesson 12.	里
学	study, learning, science		[schoolhouse]子	study	study		The <i>child</i> in the little red <i>schoolhouse</i> is there for one reason only: to <b>study</b>. Anyone who has gone through the schooling system knows well enough that <b>study</b> is one thing and learning quite another again. In the kanji, too, the character for learning (FRAME 616) has nothing to do with the <i>schoolhouse</i>. [8] 		子⺌冖
度	degrees, occurrence, time, counter for occurrences, consider, attitude		[caverns]又	degrees	degrees		This key word refers to a gradation of measurement, not to academic diplomas. Its primitives: <i>caverns</i> . . . <i>crotch</i>.		又广一凵
説	opinion, theory, explanation, rumor		言兑	rumor	explanation		Not inappropriately, this character likens an <b>explanation</b> to the <i>devil's</i> own <i>words</i>.	Editor's note. Keyword was changed in RTK6 from <b>rumor</b> to <b>explanation</b>	言口并儿
士	gentleman, scholar, samurai, samurai radical (no. 33)		士	gentleman	gentleman	samurai	The shape of this kanji, slightly differing from that for <i>soil</i> by virtue of its shorter final stroke, hints at a broad-shouldered, slender-waisted warrior standing at attention. When feudalism collapsed, these warriors became Japan's <b>gentlemen</b>.	The primitive meaning reverts to the more colorful image of the <i>samurai</i>, Japan's warrior class.	士
夫	husband, man		一大	husband	husband		The kanji for <i>a</i> <b>husband</b> or "head of the family" is based on the kanji for <i>large</i> and an extra line near the top for the "head." Recall the kanji for <i>heavens</i> already learned back in frame 457, and be sure to keep your story for this kanji different.		人二大
修	discipline, conduct oneself well, study, master		人丨攵彡	discipline	discipline		Person . . . walking stick . . . taskmaster . . . shape.		｜⺅彡攵
央	center, middle		口大	center	center		The elements depict a <i>St. Bernard</i> with its head and paws keeping their stick-like form, but with the middle or <b>center</b> of its body filled out in a box-like shape.		ノ一大冖
色	color		勹巴	color	color		Bound up . . . mosaic.		色巴勹
鹿	deer	[deer-abbreviated]	广ユ丨丨比	deer	deer		Drawn on the walls of a complex of <i>caves</i> near Niaux in southern France are a number of animal likenesses dating from the Upper Paleolithic period. Among them we find pictures of <b>deer</b>, some of them showing men in <b>deer</b> masks. By <i>comparing</i> their drawings to real <b>deer</b>, Stone Age people hoped to acquire power over the animal in the hunt; and by <i>comparing</i> themselves to the <b>deer</b>, to take on that animal's characteristics. But time has locked with a "double-<i>key</i>" (the extra stroke through the element for <i>key</i>) the real secret of this art form from us, and we can only surmise such meanings. But more important than the enigmas of the troglodytic mind is the way in which <i>caves</i>, a double-<i>key</i>, and <i>comparing</i> gives us the kanji for <b>deer</b>.	As a primitive, this kanji is abbreviated much the same as the <i>tiger</i> was: the lower element is dropped to leave room for a replacement: [deer-abbreviated]. Its meaning, however, remains the same. There are a very few cases (see frame 2158) in which there is no abbreviation. When this happens, we may keep the image suggested by the above explanation: <i>painting of a deer</i>.	鹿比广
恵	favor, blessing, grace, kindness		十田心	favor	favor		<i>Ten</i> . . . <i>fields</i> (or: <i>needle</i> . . . <i>brains</i>) . . . <i>heart.</i>		一心田
角	angle, corner, square, horn, antlers		勹冂丨二	angle	angle		<i>Bound up</i> . . . <i>glass canopy</i> . . . <i>walking stick</i> . . . <i>two</i>. If you write the character once, you will see why we avoided using the element for <i>soil</i>, which would prompt you to write it in improper order.	As a primitive, imagine the tool used by draftsmen and carpenters to draw right-<i>angles</i>.	角勹月｜
丈	length, ten shaku, measure, Mr., Ms., height, stature, all (one has), only, that's all, merely		一[arm]	length	length		The <b>length</b> whose measure this kanji depicts extends from the tip of one hand to the tip of the other with <i>arms</i> at full <b>length</b>. Notice the final stroke, which cuts across the vertical second stroke to distinguish it from <i>large</i> (FRAME 112). [3] 		ノ一丶
宏	wide, large		宀𠂇厶	extensive	extensive				ノ一厶宀
掘	dig, delve, excavate		扌屈	dig	dig		<i>Finger</i>s . . . yield.		｜山尸扌
